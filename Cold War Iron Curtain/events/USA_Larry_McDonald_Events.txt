#McDonald84.0.d:0 "Today in Washington, President McDonald signed Executive Order 12334, titled "United States Intelligence Activities". This order, laying out the scope of intelligence services and authorizing more freedom in intelligence collection, also directs the National Security Council and all subordinate agencies to incorporate the Western Goals Foundation, a private anti-communist domestic intelligence agency, into their operations. To casual observers, this signals a radical change in US intelligence operations and a quick loosening of any regulatory authority that agencies had in the past, bringing about more aggressive and radically anti-communist attitudes, and perhaps setting a dangerous precedent in the field of US national security at large."
#McDonald84.1.d:0 "The world was shocked today as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick, announced her delegationâ€™s suspension of activity from the UN, on orders from President McDonald. As a Permanent Member of the Security Council, a founding member and the most influential member of the UN other than the Soviet Union, this fundamentally changes the working operations of the UN for an indefinite period, and as the US delegation pulled away, a convoy destined for Washington, the Secretariat stood, shocked."
#McDonald84.2.d:0 "Having been dissolved in January 1975, the House Committee on Internal Security, known in the 1950s as the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has been re-formed on advice of President McDonald, the National Security Council, and the Western Goals Foundation. Formed to investigate "subversives" inside not only the United States but federal and state governments, HCIS is a radical step in a new direction, and some pundits have characterized it as a resurrection of McCarthyist ideals, especially in the United States Congress."
#McDonald88.0.d:0 "With the foundation of the House Committee on Internal Security and the signing of Executive Order 12334, the Western Goals Foundation continues to rise and creep into the deepest levels of the United States federal government. Founded in 1979 by Major General John Singlaub, publisher John Rees, and President McDonald, the WGF was formed to "blunt subversion, terrorism, and communism" and has acted as a private intelligence agency, keeping police and investigation files on known "subversives" since the early 1980s. Utilizing their intelligence activities, the WGF has been able to provide federal and state law enforcement agencies with crucial information about political subversives, particularly suspected communists. With President Larry McDonald in office, it is clear to most political analysts that the WGF will continue to grow in scope and influence in the coming years."
#McDonald88.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented televised public address to the people of the United States this evening, President Larry McDonald spoke on his interpretation of the nationâ€™s moral decline. Ending a fiery speech with phrases such as "militant, terroristic feminism," "radical baby-killing pro-abortion monsters," and "rabid sexual deviants, obsessed with pornography" describing in his view a large subset of the American population, McDonald urged a return to "normal Christian American values, a nuclear family, without degeneracy." While very much unlike an American president to say, this is not unprecedented for McDonald, who campaigned on a similar premise on his road to President."
#McDonald88.2.d:0 "Both Capitol Hill and the White House were swarmed with reporters today as simultaneous reports appeared that a constitutional amendment to overturn the Equal Rights Amendment was being introduced in both houses of Congress as a joint resolution. Both spokespersons said the same thing; that this was a legislative priority for President McDonald and that "the Equal Rights Amendment is an affront to basic family values that have existed in this country since itsâ€™ founding" as well as "opening the door to yet more sexual deviancy from homosexuals and the like". While not entirely shocking from this administration, pro-ERA supporters are preparing to strike back at this announcement with a series of campaigns both on the federal and state level to vote down this amendment."
#McDonald88.3.d:0 "President Larry McDonald this morning formally endorsed the introduction of a nullification amendment to the United States Constitution as a joint resolution. Initially an issue in the early 1830s when the state of South Carolina attempted to nullify federal tariffs, nullification is a theory that outlines that all 50 states have the right to nullify or declare void any federal law or decision that is made. More recently, nullification has been used to justify resistance against school integration as well as other civil rights reforms. This amendment is not surprising, but whether it will be ratified is yet to be seen."
#McDonald88.4.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, President McDonaldâ€™s cabinet has floated the idea of banning the Socialist Workersâ€™ Party from the United States. Formed in 1938 after splitting from the Socialist Party of America, the SWP faced difficulty during the Second World War and the Red Scares of the 1950s. Leaning mostly Trotskyite and with heavy support for Castroâ€™s Cuba, they present some threat to the McDonald administration, and its banning would be generally in line with his administrationâ€™s priorities."
#McDonald88.5.d:0 "Today, a major deportation operation was concluded by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, the American customs and border enforcement agency. Announced by executive order of President McDonald, the INS operation deported approximately 100,000 illegal immigrants, most in the border areas of the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Involving assistance from the National Guard, as well as use of helicopters and armored vehicles, the operation was successful, albeit somewhat controversial."
#McDonald88.6.d:0 "President McDonaldâ€™s cabinet was meeting today on an important issue, one that could fundamentally affect every American. Secretary of the Treasury George Hansen spoke up first, breaking the silence.\n\n "Well, Iâ€™m sure you all know why youâ€™re here. We should discuss the income tax."\n\nMurmurs of "theft" were heard, before McDonald spoke up. "I want to abolish the income tax. Itâ€™s a waste of government time and resources, and will be extremely helpful to free the average American from overbearing government."\n\nClaps rose around the room, as the cabinet members nodded, but one figure remained silent, before speaking up.\n\n "Mr. President, I am opposed to eliminating the income tax. For one, why not simply reform the issues present instead of getting rid of it entirely? Our income tax revenue provides most of our budgetary funds for the function of this government." Reuben Askew was very adept at his job, being the current United States Trade Representative and former Governor of Florida.\n\nMcDonald paused a second before replying, "While I somewhat agree, I think that the income tax has survived long enough and that we can earn revenue from other sources, along with decreasing our spending. Therefore, I think we shouldâ€¦""

#McDonald88.7.d:0 "In an unprecedented announcement from the White House today, President Larry McDonald has proposed the possible abolition of income tax in the United States. Making a statement ahead of a regularly scheduled press conference, McDonald referred to the income tax as "an unnecessary burden on the average American" and that abolishing the income tax would "free millions of Americans from debt slavery to their government". Understandably, most members of McDonaldâ€™s Democratic Party are expressing outrage at this announcement, issuing immediate condemnations and wishing that "President McDonald would rethink his tax strategy". It is unclear whether this proposal will actually succeed, but the fallout from it is already present."
#McDonald88.8.d:0 "At a meeting of the National Security Council, important discussions were beginning about drug policy. Gathered were President McDonald, Secretary of Defense John Singlaub, US Attorney General Roy Cohn, and Director of Central Intelligence William Casey.\n\nBased on discussions they had earlier about this, Singlaub spoke up. "Mr. President, we all know that the drug problem in this country is one of your top priorities. Iâ€™m sure all of us are in agreement that something needs to be done about it, and I have a proposal." He paused for a moment. "We should expand our anti-drug operations to just more than the Justice Department." He nodded to Cohn. "National Guard troops and Central Intelligence Agency operatives should be utilized. We need to use the deep state and all of our intelligence assets to counter this issue by all means necessary."\n\nNods from all came across the room, as Director Casey rose to speak. "I echo this, we should count on more support from the Western Goals Foundation to accomplish this goal on a domestic level."\n\nPresident McDonald nodded. "Glad to see weâ€™re all in agreement. John, brief the Chief of the National Guard Bureau about deployment and tell him to make a plan. Roy, your department needs to provide a shield for this, make up some legal justification. Director Casey, begin working on plans to infiltrate CIA agents into domestic drug gangs. Letâ€™s get this done.""
#McDonaldHess.0.d:0 "In a public statement, President McDonald called for the return of Rudolf Hess, leading member of the Nazi Party during World War II and Deputy Fuhrer, who fled Germany in 1941 to Britain in an attempt to secure peace. Having been tried and found guilty for crimes against peace during the 1946 Nuremberg Trials, Hess is currently interred alone in Spandau Prison in West Germany. The push to have Hess freed has been alive since the late 1960s under the command of his son, Wolf Rudiger Hess, and has garnered support from figures such as Geoffery Lawrence, the British judge during the Nuremberg trials, and Willy Brandt, former mayor of West Berlin and Chancellor of West Germany. However, all attempts thus far have been refused by the Soviets, as the prison is administered by the four Allied powers. This attempt by McDonald, historically extremely anti-communist, may prove different, however."
#McDonaldHess.1.d:0 "It was a cloudy day as President McDonald met with his top legal advisors, including Attorney General Roy Cohn and White House Counsel Arthur Culvahouse Jr., about the legal aspects of his public statement concerning returning Rudolf Hess.\n\nCohn began. "Mr. President, after reviewing this proposal to transfer Rudolf Hess to the US, my professional opinion is that this is legally possible, but may attract some unwanted attention."\n\nCulvahouse nodded in agreement. "Yes. Obviously the British and French need to be consulted on this, but this is going to be pitched as releasing a war criminal, and thatâ€™s something that my office will need to be ready for when it happens inevitably."\n\nMcDonald nodded. "Very well. We will go on with this plan. Contact the British and French Ambassadors, tell them to inform their governments, and to prepare for a Soviet response. Call Hessâ€™s son, let him know of what we want to do. Now we wait.""
#McDonaldHess.2.d:0 "â€˜In a rare turn to the West, Soviet General Secretary [SOV.GetLeader] has allowed the Allied Control Council to release Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison. Considered a risky move initially, the last Nazi war criminal will leave in a matter of weeks.â€™\n\nThe headline of the Washington Post featured this plus a large print of Hessâ€™s face. McDonald and Cohn stood in the Oval Office, smiling. They had won. Now, it was time to iron out extradition with Allied officials and begin logistics for bringing Hess to the US, as well as dealing with the inevitable blowback from his own party."
#McDonaldHess.3.d:0 "â€˜Unsurprisingly, the latest attempt to free Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess, spurred by US President Larry McDonald, has been halted by Soviet influence. Interred in Spandau Prison in West Berlin, which is administered by the Allied Control Council, the Soviet representative vetoed all attempts to free Hess, who is the lone occupant of the prison.â€™\n\nNothing more than a blurb in page 4 of the Washington Post, this was embarrassing to the White House and President McDonald, who, after reading this, was fuming silently. Damn Soviets."

#McDonaldHess.6.d:0 "A fairly nondescript Boeing 727 with State Department markings landed at Washington Dulles International Airport this evening under the cover of darkness, with only one important passenger; Rudolf Hess. With no fanfare, Hess was put into a black Chevrolet Suburban and rushed away, presumably to live in peace in the United States."
