  arg.2.d: "General Perón has completed with the honorable members of Peronism of the Congress and the Senate the Constitutional Reform of 1949, which will guarantee all the full rights to the workers of Argentina and that will give the necessary executive powers to our Most Excellent Leader.

  arg.4.t: "Cult of General Peron"
  arg.4.d: "The Peronist government officially proclaims the establishment of the cult of personality of Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina. This measure seeks to enhance his figure as a visionary leader and defender of the rights of the Argentine people, consolidating his legacy and strengthening his political power. Perón rises to the category of a national symbol, generating devotion and loyalty among his followers. The cult is used to massively mobilize popular support around his leadership, creating a sense of unity and community among the followers of Peronism. The government strengthens its authority and political legitimacy, strengthening the control of the justicialist party over State institutions. A narrative is promoted that glorifies Perón's achievements, minimizing his mistakes and controversies during his government."

  arg.5.t: "The Visca Commission"
  arg.5.d: "The press opposed to the National and Popular Model of our General is attacking with fallacies, such as that there are opposition politicians tortured and political detainees in the Perón regime. Who could come up with such a fallacy? Due to these accusations without real grounds, our Minister of the Interior, Ángel Borlenghi, recommended us to the Deputy, Journalist and Constitutionalist José Emilio Visca, a Peronist who will launch the Visca Commission, a bicameral parliamentary commission that will have to investigate the complaints of the opposition to prove our innocence. But Visca insists that it must use it to launch a campaign to put an end to the coup-mongering opposition press and traitor to the homeland of National Justicialism, which from provincial or private commercial headlines would be employing a smear campaign to the workers' popular government. Do we use the idea of Visca or do we listen to some of our ministers who recommend us to comply with the main original objectives of the Visca Commission?"

  arg.7.t: "The Residence Law is maintained"
  arg.7.d: "Our Parliamentarian and Constitutionalist
  Arturo Sampay notified us that we were able to integrate the Residence Law into the New Constitution of the Republic without problems, in order to defend the immigrant labor movement with toxic political ideas that only seek to promote sabotage, anarchy, disorder, the destruction of moral values, promote crime and the destruction of our Christian and Western society. The opposition may complain, but they must understand that we must keep the Argentine labor movement healthy and strong from these plagues such as communism and socialism."
  arg.7.a: "Long live Peronism¡"
  arg.8.t: "Borlenghi Takes Action in the Matter"
  arg.8.d: "Our Minister of the Interior, Ángel Borlenghi, informs us that there are unions where questionable ideas about trade unionism and Peronism are being promoted. The supreme power of our leader over all national unions is being questioned and there is talk of Labour union independence against the workers' government. This is unacceptable and that is why Borlenghi tells us to send it to each of the Trade Union Committees that cause problems in the Organization of the CGT and the other Peronist Trade Union Organizations, that he will be in charge of confiscating them or closing the unions with rebellious or dissident thoughts. it is time to put an end to any possible pro-independence union thinking of the Peronist party."

  arg.9.t: "The Report of Juan Duarte"
  arg.9.d: "Our Secretary, Juan Duarte, has just informed General Perón that there are Undersecretariats that are about to be renewed and there are several members of the party who want to be employed in other positions. The question comes in who to appoint the vacant positions to, since he informs us that the CGT and the Borlenghi trade unionists such as the friends of Raul Apold are predisposed to accept those positions, and on the other hand, the former collaborators of Bramuglia and Domingo Mercante also have good Peronists on their side wanting to accept those positions. To whom will we give the Undersecretaries?."
  arg.9.a: "Let's choose the Friends of Borlenghi and Apold"
  arg.9.b: "Let's Choose the Friends of Domingo Mercante"
  arg.10.t: "The Problem of Opposition Radio and Newspapers"
  arg.10.d: "Visca and Apold were having a meeting with Borlenghi and learned that there are several independent provincial newspapers from the interior, Free Radios and trade newspapers that, not being controlled by Peronism, can be a basis for the opposition to invent fallacies and slanders of the Peronist movement. Faced with this situation, Visca and Borlenghi recommended using a harsh and strong censorship against them. One of those present, Mr. Apold, emphasized that newspapers like La Vanguardia, of socialist ideology and having direct links with the Socialist Party of Alfredo Palacios, could impose a dangerous Marxist thought on the Argentine workers. Given that, he recommended tightening censorship against that group of the opposition press. The report of this meeting reached Perón, and Mercante consulted Perón about what had happened. After learning about this, Mercante, knowing the opinion of President Perón, recommended him to implement a light partial censorship. What suggestion will Perón listen to?."
  arg.10.a: "Let's listen to Borlenghi and Visca"
