  arg_news.1605.d: "From the arid Chaco to the mountainous Tierra del Fuego, passing through the Plains of Córdoba, all Argentines have closed ranks in the face of the unexpected defeat of Peronism at the polls. In the face of the Radicalism of the Cordoba Line led by Amadeo Sabattini, the Yrigoyenism that seemed already dead since the coup d'état of 1930 revives once again to rule the Argentine nation completely. Sabattini, from Córdoba capital, gave his presidential victory speech and announced the return of the sovereign, federal, and popular Argentina of the working masses. Those same people who decades ago voted for Hipólito Yrigoyen and traditional radicalism in the post-conservative Argentina of the beginning of the century. The popular Peronism declared itself on a war footing to combat the radical personalists and the conservatives, while the socialists showed their support for the new radical government that was born in Córdoba for the whole country. National journalists report violent encounters between radical and Peronist shock groups in the main cities, while the victorious Sabattini denounces a fascist conspiracy against his popular government. He only says that he will defend Argentine democracy with weapons and with blood if necessary."

In this case, led by Mr. Robustiano Patron Costas, the conservative candidate from the north of Argentina preferred to give his victory speech in Rosario province of Santa Fe, in the interior where he obtained the most votes. He announced that he would start a firm democracy, a federal and republican Argentina that will fight Peronist Fascism and Soviet Communism. Peronism called for the convocation of the 62 Peronist organizations to multi-party popular congresses to organize themselves to make the transition from officialism to the opposition of the entire Peronist movement. Meanwhile, the Radical Civic Union declared itself in opposition to the new conservative government but mentioned that it would be willing to reach an agreement with Costas and the conservatives to give them governability in the current post-Peronist Argentina."

  arg_news.1616.d: "Today, September 28, 1951, occurred in Argentina when troops of the Army, Navy and Aeronautics under the command of retired General Benjamin Menendez tried to overthrow the government of President Juan Domingo Perón. In their brief proclamation, the rebels accuse the government of having led the nation to “a total bankruptcy of its internal and external credit, both morally and spiritually as well as materially.” The restrictions on civic freedoms and the actions of opponents, the constitutional reform that allowed the re-election of the President, as well as the measures of politicization of the armed forces seem to have influenced the military adherents to the movement. The rebel troops met the resistance of the non-commissioned officers in charge of the tanks of the initial force and they lacked the support of units they thought they could count on, so after half a day they surrendered to the loyal forces."
