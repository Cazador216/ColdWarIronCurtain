 text_native_unrest_tt:0 "§gWhen the Japanese Empire surrendered in 1945, Taiwan Island was ceeded back to the Republic of China. The Kuomintang government, favouring centralisation and sinification policies, have already taken various measures to allign the Taiwanese province into the Chinese state including emphasising Chinese language, history and a curriculum supporting the ideology of the Kuomintang. However, considering that the majority of the Taiwanese people have been disconnected from Chinas influence for over five decades, it is clear that they are not willing to adapt to every doctrine layed out by a mainlander-dominated government.\n\n§RWe have to choose our measures carefully, otherwise we might risk a rebellion that will weaken our operations to retake the mainland and pose a serious threat to our government.§! §!"

 text_kmt_strength_tt:0 "§g“The Chinese revolution has failed,” Chiang Kai-shek said in 1932. “My only desire today is to restore the revolutionary spirit that the Chinese Kuomintang had in 1924”. The Kuomintang had risen to power by promising various social and economic reforms to the Chinese people. But following the defeat of the Beiyang clique, the party only focused on maintaining and expanding its power and fighting the communist Chinese movement. Unefficient bureaucrats, corruption, factionalism and opportunism contributed to the downfall of the Kuomintang and its defeat against the Communist Party on the mainland. It is in our best interest to put an end to this misery and take steps to reform the Kuomintang into a united efficient party, free of opportunists and corruption, a party of the truly Chinese patriots and a party of action, not words.§!"

After the fall of the Chinese mainland and the invasion of South Korea by the regime in Pyongyang, the United States have declared their support for us in our fight against Communism in Asia. Their military arsenal will greatly benefit our army and will play a crucial role in retaking the Chinese mainland. But it would be wise to limit the political impact that Washington will have...§!"

 premier_description_tt:0 "§gThe Premier of the Republic of China serves as the head of the Republican government and as leader of the Executive Yuan. The Premier is appointed by the President of the Republic and is responsible for the recommendation of the vice premier, ministers of the government as well as chairpersons of the Executive Yuan, which are then to be appointed by the President. The Premier has the duty of the representation of administrative policies and has to report law propsals to Legislators and asking for the law resolution. The Premier may serve as the Vice President, should the current Vice President take office as the President until the rest of the original presidential term is served. The Premier has to resign from office if a motion of no-confidence is initiated by the Legislative and approved with a simple majority. Given the current power of Chiang Kai-sheks presidential position, it is unlikely that the Prime Minister will hold any significant powers in the government as of now." 
 president_vice_description_tt:0 "§gAccording to Article 49 of the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China, the Vice President serves as the second-highest officer of the Republic and shall succeed the office of President in case the office should become vacant until the expiration of the original presidential term. The Vice President also serves as the representative of the President if he should be unable to attend to office. If the Vice President shall replace the presidential office, the current President of the Executive Yuan and Prime Minister of the Republic of China will fill the role of Vice President. The office, alongside with the presidential office, is given by the National Assembly every 6 years but holds very little formal power in the Republican government and heavily depends on the policy-agenda of the President§g."
 president_description_tt:0 "§gThe President of the Republic of China serves as the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the Republican Forces. According to the Constitution of the Republic of China from 1947, which re-established China as a parliamentarian Republic, the President merely holds ceremonial powers and little to no real executive power on paper and is elected by the National Assembly every six years.\n\nFollowing the decision of the National Assembly to support Chiang Kai-shek as President however, Chiang continued to expand his powers, transfering power from the Legislative Yuan and the Premier to the President which resulted in the personalisation of power in the Republic instead of institutionalisation, making power thus dependent on the candidate instead of the institutional position.§!"
