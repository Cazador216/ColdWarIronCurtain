 Dem_1980_Primary.1.d:0 "To the excitement of many Democrats, Senator Ted Kennedy announced he would challenge President Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primaries to represent the party for the upcoming Presidential Elections. The decision to challenge an incumbent President certainly has few parallels in American political history. The Senator made the decision after consulting with his family. Analysts note that Kennedy believes his family legacy and mystique will decisively overcome whatever incumbent advantage President Carter possesses. A source close to Kennedy noted the Senator had no confidence in how President Carter was governing, noting his poor approval rating."
 Dem_1980_Primary.2.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy and his top advisors are holding discussions on how to approach media. All recognize it will be a difficult challenge to defeat an incumbent President. The first challenge is an upcoming interview with respected CBS political reporter Ted Mudd. The interview will occur three days before the candidacy. All agree the Senator must continue to build anticipation to maximize excitement among democrats in the lead up to the official announcement. The Senator and key staff members are inclined to use the interview as a way to tease the electorate, setting up the nation for the official announcement. However, other advisors suggest the Senator use the interview to lay out his agenda and perspective, to demonstrate presidential decisiveness. However, doing so may weaken the historical impact of the official announcement. After intense discussion a decision was reached…"
 Dem_1980_Primary.3.d:0 "The interview of Senator Ted Kennedy by respected CBS reporter Ted Mudd became a disaster for the presidential hopeful. When the journalist pressed the Senator on why he wanted to be President, Ted Kennedy appeared uncomfortable and repetitive. The Senator also appeared unprepared when asked about the notorious Chappaquiddick incident. Critics noted Senator Kennedy answered questions rather vaguely. Polls taken after the interview show a sharp decline in popularity for the Senator as many Americans do not recognize him as a proper inheritor of the Kennedy mystique. Privately, advisors to the Senator admit the interview did not go as planned and efforts to use the interview to build anticipation for the official announcement did not translate to the public."
 Dem_1980_Primary.4.d:0 "The interview of Senator Ted Kennedy by respected CBS reporter Ted Mudd ended in a roaring success for the presidential hopeful. When the journalist pressed the Senator on why he wanted to be President, Ted Kennedy showed decisiveness, laying out his criticism of President Carter and his own qualifications for the highest office in the land. Despite some struggle when asked about the notorious Chappaquiddick incident, critics noted Kennedy spoke like a Kennedy. Polls taken after the interview show a boost to the Senator and analysts believe President Jimmy Carter faces a daunting primary campaign. The official announcement by Senator Kennedy is expected to occur in the coming days."
 Dem_1980_Primary.5.d:0 "The President Jimmy Carter started the 1980 Democratic primary campaign with a resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses. The victory is a major blow to challenger Senator Ted Kennedy who faces the daunting task of defeating a sitting President. Analysts note the victory gives the President legitimacy and momentum before the next set of primary contests. Analysts note Senator Kennedy has struggled to capture the imagination of democratic voters, due to lackluster appearances. Many establishment democrats have also shown an inclination to support President Carter, believing the party cannot lose the advantage of incumbent. Despite the setback, Senator Kennedy remained defiant, claiming his campaign will only grow stronger in the coming weeks. Both sides will clearly continue to campaign aggressively against each other."
 Dem_1980_Primary.6.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy was announced the winner of the Iowa caucuses, starting off the Democratic primary campaign with an opening victory. The defeat of President Carter will shake his support, especially among establishment Democrats as his incumbent status failed to counter the challenge of the fiery Massachusetts Senator. President Jimmy Carter did not express concern as he noted the contest was close and he was confident that in the end, the American people would rally to him. A jubilant Senator Kennedy thanked his supporters, promising to use the momentum gained in Iowa to achieve a historical victory. Both sides will clearly continue to campaign aggressively against each other."
 Dem_1980_Primary.7.d:0 "President Jimmy Carter has won the New Hampshire Primary. The jubilant President stated the result was a clear indication of his mandate. Analysts note the victory will increase support for the President among establishment Democrats as the victory occurred in New England, the main base of the Kennedy dynasty. The challenger, Senator Ted Kennedy remained confident, noting the results were close and he promised to not to give up the fight. Regardless, the Democratic primary campaign will continue to be a bitter, hard fought contest state to state."
 Dem_1980_Primary.8.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy has won the New Hampshire Primary. The Senator appeared over the moon as he profusely thanked his staff and supporters. He continued to note the American people were on a path of historical change to restore confidence in the Democratic Party. President Jimmy Carter remained poised and confident, stating the primary campaign had only just begun and once all Democrats were heard, the results would be in his favor. Despite his public confidence, people close to the President expressed concern that this setback may weaken support from establishment Democrats, whose support will be critical."
 Dem_1980_Primary.9.d:0 "As Democratic Party leaders and delegates arrive in New York City for the Democratic National Convention, the eyes of the nation will be upon them. The convention is expected to be contested with both incumbent President Jimmy Carter and challenger Senator Ted Kennedy fighting for the Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy launched an aggressive campaign during the primary season, leading to bitter campaigning between him and President Carter. Many Democratic leaders are said to be disappointed by the bitter campaign as many feel it has eroded the political capital of both potential candidates. As the convention begins, supporters for both candidates will be holding talks with delegates and power brokers to secure the nomination."
 Dem_1980_Primary.10.d:0 "News from Madison Square Garden confirms that President Jimmy Carter has won the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. This ends a difficult primary campaign in which the incumbent faced a spirited challenge from Senator Ted Kennedy. It is not clear yet if the Senator has congratulated the President. Democratic Party leaders will now hope the party can now rally behind President Carter as they look forward to what will undoubtably be a bitter campaign against the Republican nominee. The President thanked the delegates and urged party supporters to now come together."
 Dem_1980_Primary.11.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy gave his concession speech to the Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden. It is being received as the greatest speech of his career. Kennedy gave an unapologetic, nostalgic defense of post-war liberalism, government programs, and called for a national health insurance program. Noting even if programs were inefficient, the "ideal of fairness always endures." He criticized the Republican vision and congratulated President Jimmy Carter. He concluded the speech by quoting a poem beloved by his revered elder siblings, ending with the memorable phrase, "the dream shall never die." The crowd interrupted with applause over fifty times. Despite the powerful address, critics did note Senator Kennedy did not give a strong endorsement of President Carter and implicitly criticized his moderate views. It appears the Democratic Party will remain conflicted on how deeply it embraces its liberal values."
 Dem_1980_Primary.12.d:0 "Despite facing the historical strength of the incumbent and establishment Democratic leaders, Senator Ted Kennedy successfully defeated President Jimmy Carter to be nominated of the Democratic Party for President. During the difficult primary campaign, Kennedy managed to rally Democratic support over his embrace of liberal values. Political experts see the victory of Kennedy as the defeat of moderate Democratic power over the party. President Carter, graciously conceded, though privately, close advisors say he is stunned by the defeat. Democratic leaders are now using the convention to establish a united front in preparation for the national campaign. It is clear the 1980 election will be a cultural battle between liberalism and conservatism."
 Dem_1980_Primary.13.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy gave his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden. It is being received as the greatest speech of his career so far. Kennedy gave an unapologetic, nostalgic defense of post-war liberalism, government programs, and called for a national health insurance program. Noting even if programs were inefficient, the "ideal of fairness always endures." He criticized the Republican vision and promised to never compromise on a liberal vision for the nation. He congratulated President Jimmy Carter for his gracious concession. To conclude, he quoted a poem beloved by his revered elder siblings, ending with the memorable phrase, "the dream shall never die." The crowd interrupted with applause over fifty times. The victory of Senator Kennedy indicates the liberal wing of the Democratic Party has now supplanted the moderate establishment."

 McDonald84.0.d:0 "Today in Washington, President McDonald signed Executive Order 12334, titled "United States Intelligence Activities". This order, laying out the scope of intelligence services and authorizing more freedom in intelligence collection, also directs the National Security Council and all subordinate agencies to incorporate the Western Goals Foundation, a private anti-communist domestic intelligence agency, into their operations. To casual observers, this signals a radical change in US intelligence operations and a quick loosening of any regulatory authority that agencies had in the past, bringing about more aggressive and radically anti-communist attitudes, and perhaps setting a dangerous precedent in the field of US national security at large."
 McDonald84.1.d:0 "The world was shocked today as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick, announced her delegation’s suspension of activity from the UN, on orders from President McDonald. As a Permanent Member of the Security Council, a founding member and the most influential member of the UN other than the Soviet Union, this fundamentally changes the working operations of the UN for an indefinite period, and as the US delegation pulled away, a convoy destined for Washington, the Secretariat stood, shocked."
 McDonald84.2.d:0 "Having been dissolved in January 1975, the House Committee on Internal Security, known in the 1950s as the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has been re-formed on advice of President McDonald, the National Security Council, and the Western Goals Foundation. Formed to investigate "subversives" inside not only the United States but federal and state governments, HCIS is a radical step in a new direction, and some pundits have characterized it as a resurrection of McCarthyist ideals, especially in the United States Congress."
 McDonald88.0.d:0 "With the foundation of the House Committee on Internal Security and the signing of Executive Order 12334, the Western Goals Foundation continues to rise and creep into the deepest levels of the United States federal government. Founded in 1979 by Major General John Singlaub, publisher John Rees, and President McDonald, the WGF was formed to "blunt subversion, terrorism, and communism" and has acted as a private intelligence agency, keeping police and investigation files on known "subversives" since the early 1980s. Utilizing their intelligence activities, the WGF has been able to provide federal and state law enforcement agencies with crucial information about political subversives, particularly suspected communists. With President Larry McDonald in office, it is clear to most political analysts that the WGF will continue to grow in scope and influence in the coming years."
 McDonald88.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented televised public address to the people of the United States this evening, President Larry McDonald spoke on his interpretation of the nation’s moral decline. Ending a fiery speech with phrases such as "militant, terroristic feminism," "radical baby-killing pro-abortion monsters," and "rabid sexual deviants, obsessed with pornography" describing in his view a large subset of the American population, McDonald urged a return to "normal Christian American values, a nuclear family, without degeneracy." While very much unlike an American president to say, this is not unprecedented for McDonald, who campaigned on a similar premise on his road to President."
 McDonald88.2.d:0 "Both Capitol Hill and the White House were swarmed with reporters today as simultaneous reports appeared that a constitutional amendment to overturn the Equal Rights Amendment was being introduced in both houses of Congress as a joint resolution. Both spokespersons said the same thing; that this was a legislative priority for President McDonald and that "the Equal Rights Amendment is an affront to basic family values that have existed in this country since its’ founding" as well as "opening the door to yet more sexual deviancy from homosexuals and the like". While not entirely shocking from this administration, pro-ERA supporters are preparing to strike back at this announcement with a series of campaigns both on the federal and state level to vote down this amendment."
 McDonald88.3.d:0 "President Larry McDonald this morning formally endorsed the introduction of a nullification amendment to the United States Constitution as a joint resolution. Initially an issue in the early 1830s when the state of South Carolina attempted to nullify federal tariffs, nullification is a theory that outlines that all 50 states have the right to nullify or declare void any federal law or decision that is made. More recently, nullification has been used to justify resistance against school integration as well as other civil rights reforms. This amendment is not surprising, but whether it will be ratified is yet to be seen."
 McDonald88.4.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, President McDonald’s cabinet has floated the idea of banning the Socialist Workers’ Party from the United States. Formed in 1938 after splitting from the Socialist Party of America, the SWP faced difficulty during the Second World War and the Red Scares of the 1950s. Leaning mostly Trotskyite and with heavy support for Castro’s Cuba, they present some threat to the McDonald administration, and its banning would be generally in line with his administration’s priorities."
 McDonald88.5.d:0 "Today, a major deportation operation was concluded by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, the American customs and border enforcement agency. Announced by executive order of President McDonald, the INS operation deported approximately 100,000 illegal immigrants, most in the border areas of the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Involving assistance from the National Guard, as well as use of helicopters and armored vehicles, the operation was successful, albeit somewhat controversial."
 McDonald88.6.d:0 "President McDonald’s cabinet was meeting today on an important issue, one that could fundamentally affect every American. Secretary of the Treasury George Hansen spoke up first, breaking the silence.\n\n "Well, I’m sure you all know why you’re here. We should discuss the income tax."\n\nMurmurs of "theft" were heard, before McDonald spoke up. "I want to abolish the income tax. It’s a waste of government time and resources, and will be extremely helpful to free the average American from overbearing government."\n\nClaps rose around the room, as the cabinet members nodded, but one figure remained silent, before speaking up.\n\n "Mr. President, I am opposed to eliminating the income tax. For one, why not simply reform the issues present instead of getting rid of it entirely? Our income tax revenue provides most of our budgetary funds for the function of this government." Reuben Askew was very adept at his job, being the current United States Trade Representative and former Governor of Florida.\n\nMcDonald paused a second before replying, "While I somewhat agree, I think that the income tax has survived long enough and that we can earn revenue from other sources, along with decreasing our spending. Therefore, I think we should…""

 McDonald88.7.d:0 "In an unprecedented announcement from the White House today, President Larry McDonald has proposed the possible abolition of income tax in the United States. Making a statement ahead of a regularly scheduled press conference, McDonald referred to the income tax as "an unnecessary burden on the average American" and that abolishing the income tax would "free millions of Americans from debt slavery to their government". Understandably, most members of McDonald’s Democratic Party are expressing outrage at this announcement, issuing immediate condemnations and wishing that "President McDonald would rethink his tax strategy". It is unclear whether this proposal will actually succeed, but the fallout from it is already present."
 McDonald88.8.d:0 "At a meeting of the National Security Council, important discussions were beginning about drug policy. Gathered were President McDonald, Secretary of Defense John Singlaub, US Attorney General Roy Cohn, and Director of Central Intelligence William Casey.\n\nBased on discussions they had earlier about this, Singlaub spoke up. "Mr. President, we all know that the drug problem in this country is one of your top priorities. I’m sure all of us are in agreement that something needs to be done about it, and I have a proposal." He paused for a moment. "We should expand our anti-drug operations to just more than the Justice Department." He nodded to Cohn. "National Guard troops and Central Intelligence Agency operatives should be utilized. We need to use the deep state and all of our intelligence assets to counter this issue by all means necessary."\n\nNods from all came across the room, as Director Casey rose to speak. "I echo this, we should count on more support from the Western Goals Foundation to accomplish this goal on a domestic level."\n\nPresident McDonald nodded. "Glad to see we’re all in agreement. John, brief the Chief of the National Guard Bureau about deployment and tell him to make a plan. Roy, your department needs to provide a shield for this, make up some legal justification. Director Casey, begin working on plans to infiltrate CIA agents into domestic drug gangs. Let’s get this done.""
 McDonaldHess.0.d:0 "In a public statement, President McDonald called for the return of Rudolf Hess, leading member of the Nazi Party during World War II and Deputy Fuhrer, who fled Germany in 1941 to Britain in an attempt to secure peace. Having been tried and found guilty for crimes against peace during the 1946 Nuremberg Trials, Hess is currently interred alone in Spandau Prison in West Germany. The push to have Hess freed has been alive since the late 1960s under the command of his son, Wolf Rudiger Hess, and has garnered support from figures such as Geoffery Lawrence, the British judge during the Nuremberg trials, and Willy Brandt, former mayor of West Berlin and Chancellor of West Germany. However, all attempts thus far have been refused by the Soviets, as the prison is administered by the four Allied powers. This attempt by McDonald, historically extremely anti-communist, may prove different, however."
 McDonaldHess.1.d:0 "It was a cloudy day as President McDonald met with his top legal advisors, including Attorney General Roy Cohn and White House Counsel Arthur Culvahouse Jr., about the legal aspects of his public statement concerning returning Rudolf Hess.\n\nCohn began. "Mr. President, after reviewing this proposal to transfer Rudolf Hess to the US, my professional opinion is that this is legally possible, but may attract some unwanted attention."\n\nCulvahouse nodded in agreement. "Yes. Obviously the British and French need to be consulted on this, but this is going to be pitched as releasing a war criminal, and that’s something that my office will need to be ready for when it happens inevitably."\n\nMcDonald nodded. "Very well. We will go on with this plan. Contact the British and French Ambassadors, tell them to inform their governments, and to prepare for a Soviet response. Call Hess’s son, let him know of what we want to do. Now we wait.""
 McDonaldHess.2.d:0 "‘In a rare turn to the West, Soviet General Secretary [SOV.GetLeader] has allowed the Allied Control Council to release Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison. Considered a risky move initially, the last Nazi war criminal will leave in a matter of weeks.’\n\nThe headline of the Washington Post featured this plus a large print of Hess’s face. McDonald and Cohn stood in the Oval Office, smiling. They had won. Now, it was time to iron out extradition with Allied officials and begin logistics for bringing Hess to the US, as well as dealing with the inevitable blowback from his own party."
 McDonaldHess.3.d:0 "‘Unsurprisingly, the latest attempt to free Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess, spurred by US President Larry McDonald, has been halted by Soviet influence. Interred in Spandau Prison in West Berlin, which is administered by the Allied Control Council, the Soviet representative vetoed all attempts to free Hess, who is the lone occupant of the prison.’\n\nNothing more than a blurb in page 4 of the Washington Post, this was embarrassing to the White House and President McDonald, who, after reading this, was fuming silently. Damn Soviets."
 McDonaldHess.4.d:0 "In a rare turn to the West, Soviet General Secretary [SOV.GetLeader] has allowed the Allied Control Council to release Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Considered a risky move initially, the last Nazi war criminal will leave in a matter of weeks."
 McDonaldHess.5.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the latest attempt to free Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess, spurred by US President Larry McDonald, has been halted by Soviet influence. Interred in Spandau Prison in West Berlin, which is administered by the Allied Control Council, the Soviet representative vetoed all attempts to free Hess, who is the lone occupant of the prison."  
 McDonaldHess.6.d:0 "A fairly nondescript Boeing 727 with State Department markings landed at Washington Dulles International Airport this evening under the cover of darkness, with only one important passenger; Rudolf Hess. With no fanfare, Hess was put into a black Chevrolet Suburban and rushed away, presumably to live in peace in the United States."
 McDonaldHess.10.d:0 "We have received word from the Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces, Germany (GSFG) as well as the Allied Control Council that an appeal is in place to release Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison in West Berlin, and turn him to live in the United States. Previously, our government has denied any request, but based on an appeal from US President Larry McDonald, it has garnered international headlines, particularly as Hess is sick and the sole occupant of Spandau Prison, which is extremely expensive to maintain. What shall our decision be?"

 McDonald88.10.d:0 "There was considerable shock in the United States today as a constitutional amendment overturning the Equal Rights Amendment was ratified by the Alabama state legislature, marking the two-thirds majority required to put it into law. Originally guaranteeing the equal rights of all people, particularly against discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation, the administration of Larry McDonald has decried it as being counter to traditional American family values."
 McDonald88.11.d:0 "Considerable relief spread throughout the United States today as a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives soundly voted against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have overturned the Equal Rights Amendment. Proposed by President Larry McDonald, who campaigned on homophobic rhetoric, the burgeoning gay community in the United States is overjoyed today as victory was secured."
 McDonald88.12.d:0 "Legal experts looked on with wonder today as a constitutional amendment codifying nullification was ratified today by the Virginia state legislature, marking the two-thirds majority required to put it into law. Originally presented during the 1830s Nullification Crisis, this legal theory, more recently practiced over the fight for desegregation, states that states can nullify federal legislation if they do not agree. This precedent, now set into the Constitution, presents a confusing legal situation in the United States."
 McDonald88.13.d:0 "Considerable relief spread throughout the United States today as a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives soundly voted against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have codified nullification by states. Proposed by President Larry McDonald, the amendment would have allowed states to ignore federal law if they did not agree with it, leading to confusing legal issues."

 Rockefeller75.0.d:0 "Today in Washington, President Nelson Rockefeller has announced one of his first major policy goals: the creation of a task force focusing on gun control. In an executive order signed today, the new President’s Council on Gun Control will consist of officials from every major American city as well as FBI and other law enforcement officials. Expected to face resistance from firearm manufacturers as well as the National Rifle Association, many moderate Republicans and Democrats hail this as the first step towards reducing crime and gun violence in the United States."
 Rockefeller75.1.d:0 "In a major press conference today, US President Nelson Rockefeller introduced his administration’s policy push, known as the "Fair Society" Program. Mainly consisting of federal policies taken from his time as Governor of New York, the Fair Society Program will consist of a push towards more public housing, drug laws focusing on rehabilitation rather than imprisonment, expanded civil rights legislation, expanded Medicare and Medicaid programs, and an expanded transportation development system. Expected to both appeal to Rockefeller’s liberal GOP base as well as most Democrats, the plan may face some resistance from within Rockefeller’s own Republican Party, particularly with so-called "debt-hawk" congressmen in the House."
 Rockefeller76.1.d:0 "It came as little surprise today as the White House, in an official press conference, announced the firings of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and White House Chief of Staff Dick Cheney. Both holdovers from President Ford’s administration, both men remained under Rockefeller after the assassination of Ford in September 1975. Due to their ideological positions as more hardline conservatives, in sharp contrast to Rockefeller’s liberal wing of the GOP, Rumsfeld and Cheney were let go, and are expected to remain in the Republican Party, aligning themselves primarily with the Reagan/Bush wing of the party."
 Rockefeller76.2.d:0 "US President Nelson Rockefeller today has introduced a proposal to the US Congress to amend the Constitution to end what is known as the "natural-born-citizen" clause; which stipulates that only American citizens born on American soil are eligible to run for president. While the Constitution does not explicitly define what "natural-born-citizen" means, the clause has been widely interpreted as preventing foreign citizens from assuming office in the United States. Several constitutional amendments have been introduced concerning this issue, the most recent in 1974 being when Representative Jonathan Brewster Bingham of New York introduced an similar amendment with the intent of allowing Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to assume his place in the presidential line of succession.\n\nIt is unclear the range of public opinion on this issue but the amendment must first make its way through Congress before state legislatures can ratify it."
 Rockefeller76.3.d:0 "Somewhat shockingly, a proposed constitutional amendment to end the "natural-born-citizen" clause of the US Constitution has been approved by a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives and been successfully ratified by the two-thirds majority of states, with the passing of the New Jersey state legislature. Expected to be a major change in eligibility to run for presidential office, this will allow Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to be in the presidential line of succession. While public opinion tends to be somewhat apathetic, the most vocal demographic is the burgeoning American immigrant community, who now feel validated and able to be a part of the democratic process even though they were not born in the United States."
 Rockefeller76.4.d:0 "Not surprisingly, a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives has again soundly rejected a proposed constitutional amendment removing the "natural-born-citizen" clause, remaining with the status quo and not allowing foreign citizens to be eligible to run for president or other federal office. While not entirely unexpected, the push to allow eligibility has been high in the recent period, but has faced general opposition and apathy from average Americans as well as hardline Republicans in Congress."
 Rockefeller76.5.d:0 "With the recent firing of Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, the Rockefeller administration and Republican Party has effectively sidelined the hardline, neo-conservative Reaganite faction of the party, sometimes known as the "Moral Majority" from any significant positions within the executive branch. Guaranteeing near-hegemony from the liberal wing of the GOP, known as the "Responsible Republicans," the Rockefeller administration is assured of no internal resistance to their policies, at least in the White House."
 Rockefeller76.6.d:0 "It was a sunny day in Washington as President Rockefeller stood in front of the Interior Department Building, flanked by Interior Secretary Thomas Kleppe, other Interior Department officials, and members of the United States Park Police and National Park Service. Standing at the podium, Rockefeller began to speak.\n\n "Good morning. Conservation is an extremely important issue in our country, as our lands are the most important parts of America. As Governor of New York, I expanded the New York Parks System, banned DDT, and protected the Adirondacks. As President, I hope to do the same for our National Park Service System.""

 Dole80.0.d:0 "America under President Robert Dole truly has been "Fairer and Freer." In 4 years of his administration, President Dole accomplished many policy goals, including signing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the largest and most comprehensive disability rights legislation thus far; signing multiple budget, finance, and tax reform laws; passing massive revisions to the US criminal code and escalating the War on Drugs; banning affirmative action in some federal programs and, turning away from his fellow conservatives, urging the acceptance of Roe as settled law. On the foreign policy front, President Dole particularly focused on economic and trade ties with Latin America, allowing an influx of late-night TV jokes comparing President Dole to the Dole Fruit Company and so-called "banana republics" of Central America.\n\nIn the end, Dole’s unique brand of conservatism with nods to some liberal policies has resulted in a new America for the 1980s."
 Dole80.1.d:0 "In a press conference today, President Robert Dole shocked his fellow conservatives by urging nationwide acceptance of the results of Roe v. Wade as settled law.\n\nFaced with questions from reporters concerning his previous voting record on abortion, Dole responded that "It's one of those very personal, delicate issues that most of us try not to deal with" but that "I have a flawless record of protecting the unborn." Challenged with these issues, Dole attempted to backpedal, further stating that "However, we should respect the decision of the Supreme Court in 1973 - they have decided, and it is all but settled law at this point."\n\nAppearing to most of the Republican Party as an enigma on abortion, Dole is now challenged by forces from within his party who strongly oppose the results of Roe and continue to press for a national ban on abortion."
 Dole80.2.d:0 "In an executive order signed today in the Oval Office, President Dole has created the Presidential Commission on Regulatory Reform. Proposed by past conservative administrations, this new Commission has the mission of "assessing the impact of federal regulations on individual Americans, working to improve regulations and procedures, and recommending chairmen and members of the twelve federal regulatory agencies; including the Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, and Consumer Product Safety Commission."\n\nLargely hailed by both Republicans and Democrats as a reform mechanism meant to remove antiquated regulations and hopefully improve government bureaucracy, this commission is expected to form and meet as soon as possible to begin issuing directives."
 Dole80.3.d:0 "In an executive order signed today, President Dole has officially banned the policy of "affirmative action" that is used for federal programs, as well as defunding the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Originally created as a form of non-discrimination in hiring practices, the Civil Rights and women’s rights movements forced previous administrations to extend affirmative action policies to race and sex-based discrimination.\n\nCurrently, affirmative action is extended to hiring practices within the federal government, federal contractors and subcontractors, federally provided housing, and many admissions practices of publicly funded colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nCivil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have denounced this executive order as a halt to progress, while Reaganites and Dole’s base within the Republican Party heavily support this measure."
 Dole80.4.d:0 "Shortly after today’s State Department briefing, the White House held a press conference, with President Dole announcing new trade initiatives with Latin America. Attempting both to rectify past covert US involvement in Latin American internal affairs and to expand American trade and economic relations in the Americas, the President announced a new set of foreign aid packages, bilateral agreements, and trade missions, coordinated with the State Department and US Trade Representative, as well as through the mechanisms of the Organization of American States.\n\nReactions from both sides have been generally positive, but not without some opposition by hardline conservatives and leftwing elements, both of whom condemn continued US interference in Latin America."
 Dole84.1.d:0 "In a small ceremony with few reporters today, President Dole stated that "the United States formally recognizes that the deportation and massacre of ethnic Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I constitutes genocide according to international law." Surrounded by genocide survivors; including Dr. Hampar Kelikian, a Chicago orthopedist who helped to treat Dole from his injuries during World War II, the ceremony was meant primarily to showcase and remember Armenian-American immigrants and survivors of the genocide, which was approaching its 70th anniversary.\n\nReactions to this recognition have been widespread, with understandable condemnations and rebuttals by the Republic of Turkey, as well as Democrats and Republicans on both sides who argue that formal recognition is a waste of time and that the United States should not risk alienating a NATO ally over historical events."
 Dole84.2.d:0 "Reports have come in from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States under President Robert Dole has recognized the legitimate mass deportation of ethnic Armenian nationalists and terrorists from our territory as a so-called "genocide" according to international law. As a principal member of NATO, this recognition by the United States is preposterous, traitorous, and goes against the national interest of the Republic in all forms. We have already sent strongly worded messages to the US embassy in Ankara as well as communiques to our diplomatic corps to lodge a formal diplomatic protest to this action. This will not be the last that the Americans will hear from us."
 Dole88.1.d:0 "In President Robert Dole’s first term, the American landscape has been completely changed. Most importantly, four cabinet departments were completely disbanded by the Dole Administration: Commerce, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban Development. Dole also vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1990, citing race-based quotas, and amended the Clean Air Act to provide greater federal government regulation.\n\nOn the defense front, Dole pushed for expansion of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as well as expanding regulation of biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs); and infamously, deployed the US National Guard in the War on Drugs.\n\nOn the economic side, Dole pushed for greater budget enforcement, as well as signing the North American Free Trade Agreement to secure mutual economic benefits in North America. Known as the "American Renaissance" by many conservative pundits, Dole’s administration will continue to have a legacy for decades to come."
 Dole88.2.d:0 "In a press conference with congressional leaders today, President Dole urged once again for a balanced budget amendment to be put forth to a joint session of Congress. Consisting of a constitutional amendment stating that the United States cannot spend more than its annual revenues, proposed amendments relating to this have been made before, particularly during the late 1960s and 1970s when deficit spending by the federal government reappeared.\n\nHowever, with recent moves by the Dole administration to curb wasteful government spending and several pieces of budget reform legislation having been already passed there may be more momentum in the US Congress to pass this constitutional amendment."

 NAFTA.1.d:0 "In a televised press conference from the White House today, President [USA.GetLeader], flanked by his Secretary of State, announced his intention to expedite negotiations of a North American Free Trade Agreement. Envisioned as a free trade deal between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, early negotiations have begun, but have not yielded much progress. It is envisioned that with proper negotiation and enough popular public opinion, the deal will eventually come about."
 NAFTA.2.d:0 "In the United States, the President’s announcement of his intent to form a North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico has created both support and opposition recently. Many supporters speak the need for greater free trade in a rapidly modernizing and technologically developing world; particularly with the US’s direct neighbors to the north and south. However, many opposed, particularly fiscal conservatives, argue the inherent issues, such as reduced tariff revenue, issues in complicated trade regulations and customs, citing the spread of drugs within the United States, and stressing the outsourcing of jobs to Mexico and Canada, resulting in an economic downturn.\n\nThe American public, when polled, appears to be rather split on this issue, but negotiations appear to be continuing on NAFTA."
 NAFTA.3.d:0 "Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Ottawa, delivering a message from President [USA.GetLeader] about the possible formation of a North American Free Trade Agreement, between the US, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nWhile our government is generally in support of this, the Canadian public is strongly opposed to greater free trade, particularly in the latest 1988 elections and the rather controversial Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement signed in 1987. Our government’s economic advisors and ministers have determined that in no uncertain terms, the country could benefit from a free trade agreement like this, but we must keep the will of the people as well as our national sovereignty and national interest in perspective. How should we respond?"
 NAFTA.4.d:0 "We have received word from the Prime Minister’s Office in Ottawa and the Canadian Embassy in Washington that the Canadian Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on a North American Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon. Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] spoke to President [USA.GetLeader] via telephone and expressed his best wishes for future negotiations surrounding this agreement."
 NAFTA.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Canadian Ambassador in Washington has sent word from Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] in Ottawa that the Canadian Government will not be attending negotiations on a North American Free Trade Agreement. The US Ambassador in Ottawa has attempted to change their position on the issue, to no avail. This is a temporary setback for our foreign and economic policy, but we will recover."
 NAFTA.6.d:0 "President [MEX.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Mexico City, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader] about the possible formation of a North American Free Trade Agreement, between the US, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nOur government is eager to bring in more foreign investment, particularly from the United States, in the aftermath of the early 1980s Latin American debt crisis, but should be careful not to tie its economy too closely to the United States, should we ever become dependent on their economy. As well, our national interest, sovereignty, and will of the people should be taken into account with this decision. How will we respond?"
 NAFTA.7.d:0 "We have received word from the President’s Office in Mexico City and the Mexican Embassy in Washington that the Mexican Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on a North American Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon.

The US Ambassador in Mexico City has attempted to change their position on the issue, to no avail. This is a temporary setback for our foreign and economic policy, but we will recover."
 NAFTA.9.d:0 "Today, a basic framework to negotiate a North American Free Trade Agreement was signed simultaneously in Washington, Ottawa, and Mexico City, by US President [USA.GetLeader], Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] and Mexican President [MEX.GetLeader] respectively. Hailed as a major foreign policy goal in the United States, this framework will lead the way for future negotiations between the three governments on details of trade, customs, tariffs, and other items of economic interest. Supporters of NAFTA rejoice with the hope of economic benefits, while those opposed to the future plan continue to grumble about the loss of jobs to foreign countries and complicated trade regulations."
 NAFTA.10.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, internal sources from within NAFTA negotiations report the rapid deterioration of negotiations and progress between the three parties on any future North American Free Trade Agreement. All three parties; the United States, Canada, and Mexico, seem to be dissatisfied with one another on details concerning customs, cross-border travel, movement of jobs, and exchange of tariff elimination.\n\nIn particular, the proposed Chapter 11 of NAFTA allows corporations to sue any of the three countries for compensation when they violate international law; especially denounced by groups in Canada and the United States.\n\nThere are also major concerns from members of the Mexican delegation that certain articles of the Mexican Constitution dealing with indigenous land and privatization may have to be abrogated in order to reach agreement.\n\nIt is not expected that the negotiations will continue, as each delegation retreats to their capitals to consult with their governments on this matter."

 AEFTA.1.d:0 "Today in a press conference with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce, President [USA.GetLeader] announced the beginning of what are likely to be months-long negotiations for free trade between the United States and the members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Regarded as an additional move towards economic relations with Europe, a successful negotiation with EFTA would lead to the dropping of trade barriers and tariffs between those member countries, who between themselves have free trade agreements. Domestically, it appears that this development has wide support among most Americans who are aware of it, with the large majority generally apathetic of the future implications."
 AEFTA.2.d:0 "Prime Minister [ICE.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Reykjavik, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. As Iceland is a proud member, having joined in 1970, it would be in our best interest to accept the American offer, especially since our economy is largely tied to EFTA and the European Economic Community. However, some of those on the left-wing of our government believe we should not willingly tie ourselves to the American sphere of influence just yet. How will we respond?"
 AEFTA.3.d:0 "We have received word from the Prime Minister’s Office in Reykjavik and the Icelandic Embassy in Washington that the Icelandic Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on an American-European Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon.

 AEFTA.5.d:0 "Prime Minister [NOR.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Oslo, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. Being a proud founding member of both EFTA and NATO, Norway enjoys particularly close relations with both Europe and the United States, and having failed to ratify an accession to the European Economic Community, is faced with a new course to take in the emerging economic landscape. However, some within our government warn of becoming further tied to the American economic system and straying further from Europe. How will we respond?"
 AEFTA.6.d:0 "We have received word from the Prime Minister’s Office in Oslo and the Norwegian Embassy in Washington that the Norwegian Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on an American-European Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon.

 AEFTA.8.d:0 "The Chairman of the Swiss Federal Council has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Bern, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. While Switzerland has had generally good relations with the United States, it remains generally outside of the normal liberal international order, not being a UN member but hosting the headquarters for many UN agencies. Switzerland is a founding member of EFTA, but relations with other European countries and the West have been generally beneficial but not without some hiccups due to our policy of neutrality. Many in the government hail this new proposed deal as a new form of economic development, while other, more traditionalists urge a continued role in just European relations and the dangers of tying themselves to the American economic system. How will we respond?"
 AEFTA.9.d:0 "We have received word from the Federal Chancellery in Bern and the Swiss Embassy in Washington that the Swiss Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on an American-European Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon.

 AEFTA.11.d:0 "Prime Minister [FIN.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Helsinki, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. Finland, being a relatively recent addition to EFTA and the European landscape at large, due to our location abutting the Soviet Union, has recently explored a policy of Western orientation, but some independent and left-wing politicians in our government have expressed concerns with expanding ties with the United States; particularly because of the proximity to the Soviet Union as well as the fear of economic subservience. How will we respond?"
 AEFTA.12.d:0 "We have received word from the Prime Minister’s Office in Helsinki and the Finnish Embassy in Washington that the Finnish Government has accepted our initial offers to negotiate on an American-European Free Trade Agreement, with a signing on a basic framework to be determined soon.

 AEFTA.14.d:0 "Federal Chancellor [AUS.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Vienna, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. Austria has remained generally neutral, playing from the sidelines in the Cold War, and has remained generally pro-Western, being occupied by the Western Powers in the postwar years and bordering West Germany. However, some in the government protest against a possible entry into a free trade agreement with the United States, stressing the importance of neutrality in this emerging security environment. How will we respond?"

 AEFTA.17.d:0 "Prime Minister [SWE.GetLeader] has received a proposal from the US Ambassador in Stockholm, delivering a message from US President [USA.GetLeader], about the possible formation or expansion of an American-European Free Trade Agreement with the member countries of EFTA. Swedish-US relations have been strained in recent years with the outbreak of the Vietnam War, but have gradually warmed during the 1980s.

 Robertson88.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]President Robertson Announces Purge of the "Liberal" Bureacracy"
 Robertson88.0.d:0 "Since the inauguration of President Pat Robertson on January 20, 1989, much has been done in America in these four years. For one, three executive departments; State, Education, and Energy, were purged or dissolved as a means of taking out the “liberal bureaucracy”; several large congressional acts were vetoed, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1990, and an AIDS funding bill; but some were passed, such as a ban on pornography, the Federal Court Overreach Act, the Defense Modernization Act, and a proposed Right to Life amendment. Robertson also reintroduced prayer in public schools, as well as allowing vouchers for private religious schools. In the field of defense, Robertson’s administration escalated the War on Drugs, as well as passing the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act and ramping up police militarization. Many pundits and historians now consider Robertson’s term of office as the “Moral America” era, and the future is uncertain for the United States after this president."
 Robertson88.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented announcement at the White House today, President Pat Robertson announced the signing of an executive order providing for the “efficient streamlining of the Department of State” by effectively cutting somewhere between 40-50% of the department’s staff, including members of the US Foreign Service, but mostly bureaucratic personnel located in Washington as well as non-essential personnel abroad.\n\nDecried by both sides of the aisle as an irresponsible move in US foreign policy, particularly during the tension-filled period of the Cold War, President Robertson’s administration has largely remained silent on comments, aside from one statement in which Robertson remarked that “our diplomatic corps are large, ineffective, useless, and rotting to the core with liberals, communists, and other un-American sympathizers that seek to undermine us.”"
 Robertson88.2.d:0 "In a press conference today at the White House, President Pat Robertson announced his administration’s support for a “Right to Life” amendment to the United States Constitution. Forming the core of pro-life policy proposals following the result of Roe v. Wade in 1973 and also known as the “Human Life Amendment”, this amendment would codify the legal definition of human life as beginning at conception, and would explicitly ban abortion under the Constitution.\n\nFacing harsh criticism and pressure from Democrats and pro-choice advocates, Robertson dismissed them as “communist baby-killers” and expressed his full support for an amendment to be voted on, which is expected to occur in the near future in Congress."
 Robertson88.3.d:0 "In a televised ceremony from the Oval Office today, President Pat Robertson signed an executive order mandating “an immediate efficiency mechanism within the federal bureaucracy” by, within 30 days, terminating 45% of office jobs within the federal government, mostly within Washington D.C. and branch offices of selected agencies throughout the United States.\n\nLabeled by liberal groups as a “purge” against needed bureaucratic institutions, such as the Internal Revenue Service and Environmental Protection Agency, conservatives and Robertson’s supporters hail this as a major step in preventing government overreach and streamlining needed positions and duties within the federal government. However, the nearly 1 million unemployed federal workers tend to disagree, as they find new jobs in a post-Robertson America."
 Robertson88.5.d:0 "FROM: Executive Office of the President\nTO: White House Counsel; Attorney General, US Department of Justice; Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nSUBJECT: Launching Investigations Into Feminist and Liberal Groups\n\nTo All Those Concerned,\n\nThe threat of feminist, liberal, communist, socialist, and anarchist forces in our country is a particularly dangerous one, in this new era of a “Moral America” where the nuclear American family and its traditional Christian values are at risk of being exploited.\n\nI am directing all parties, but particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation and all other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to begin extensive investigations and surveillance on the following groups:\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union(ACLU)\nNational Organization for Women (NOW)\nLeague of Women Voters (LWV)\nSouthern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)\nFreedom House\nInternational Socialist Organization (ISO)\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC)\n\n Surveillance and covert investigations should be conducted on these organizations and all documentation, recordings and other media are hereby classified under the Espionage Act, and will remain in the custody of the Department of Justice and all relevant federal agencies.\n\nSIGNED\nPresident Pat Robertson"
 Robertson88.6.d:0 "Recent reports from figures within major American feminist movements, including the National Organization for Women and the League of Women Voters indicate massive internal issues and cohesion problems. A slightly larger law enforcement presence around NOW and LWV meetings, particularly those of high-level members, has been noted by some members and officials within the organizations; and some maintenance personnel have noticed slight damage to window frames, computer systems, and telephones within the national offices. It is unclear what is causing this rift and problems, but something very suspicious is happening in the feminist movement."
 Robertson88.7.d:0 "In breaking news today, a sudden leak by a Department of Justice staffer to the Attorney General revealed a government campaign of espionage on feminist and liberal organizations in the United States. Signed off by President Robertson and spearheaded by the FBI and Department of Justice, a leaked memo discussed “the threat of feminist, liberal, communist, socialist, and anarchist forces in our country” and specifying surveillance and monitoring of organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and Democratic National Convention. Published initially in the New York Times, other major newspapers domestically and internationally have caught this story, amid dead silence from the White House or the Department of Justice."
 Robertson88.8.d:0 "Days after the initial allegations of government espionage against liberal and feminist organizations in the United States, more questions have come out about what President Pat Robertson really knew concerning the details of the operation. The initial leaked memo was signed by him, confirming presidential authorization for the espionage, but many conservatives and supporters continue to question whether Robertson was really made aware or if this campaign was a unilateral decision by the Attorney General and FBI Director. Much at the moment has not bee revealed, but the President’s approval rating has dropped this week by 5 points, reflecting the American people’s clear disappointment in hearing this news."

 Reagan_VRA.1.d:0 "In an unexpected announcement today, President Ronald Reagan called for allowing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to expire. A monumental piece of legislation important to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and banning “tests or devices” to be used to control who votes, the Act was reauthorized in 1975, and is set to expire again this year in 1982. Reagan’s administration has remained largely silent on this issue until now, but the presence of amendments in the House to the VRA has attracted the White House’s attention. It is clear that most civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights will issue condemnations, but most pundits agree that this saga is only beginning."
 Reagan_VRA.2.d:0 "Following the announcement from the White House that the Reagan administration does not support a re-authorization to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, public backlash has been significant, with condemnations from the Democratic National Committee, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, American Civil Liberties Union, League of Women Voters, and National Organization for Women, as well as numerous other civil rights organizations. A comment has still not been reached from the White House, who after Reagan’s announcement are remaining rather quiet, telling reporters to direct their questions to the Hill. However, many close officials to the President have varying ideas and opinions on what should happen, with some arguing that the re-authorization should be vetoed, and others urging the President to sign, and bow to political pressure from Congress. How will Reagan choose?"
 Reagan_VRA.3.d:0 "In an unexpected move today from the White House, President Ronald Reagan backed down from his fight to kill the Voting Rights Act of 1965, instead signing a re-authorization for another 10 years. Presumably from extensive public pressure from civil rights and voting rights organizations, Reagan has acceded to their will and the will of Congress by signing the VRA reauthorization."
 Reagan_VRA.4.d:0 "Ignoring public will and unsurprising to most political pundits, President Ronald Reagan moved forward with his crusade against the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by vetoing the ten-year reauthorization bill and amendments presented to him. Eliciting yet more condemnations by civil rights and voting rights organizations, Reagan faces overwhelming pressure, not only from the public but also from members of Congress and those in his own party, who despite their differing political ideologies, do want the Voting Rights Act to remain."
 Reagan_VRA.5.d:0 "In response to President Reagan’s veto of the reauthorization for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress has initiated a veto override in line with Article I, Section VII of the Constitution in an attempt to make the reauthorization act law without going through the White House. It is too early to tell final voting margins, but with enough support, the VRA may survive another day."
 Reagan_VRA.6.d:0 "It appears that after a final vote in the US Senate that the reauthorization act for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to extend its provisions another 10 years has passed with over 2/3rds of the vote of both houses of Congress. Following President Ronald Reagan’s initial veto of the bill, it moved back to the Hill where his veto was overridden by Congress. Combined with substantial public outcry towards the White House, this serves as a warning to Reagan’s administration that the other branches of government are not to be messed with."
 Reagan_VRA.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, an attempted veto override of a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 failed today in Congress, netting less than the 2/3rds majority required. Following a rapid veto by President Ronald Reagan of the bill, Congress attempted to move to counter by passing it anyway, but did not get the required votes. Public outcry has been widespread, targeting both the White House and Capitol Hill as multiple branches of government have been blamed for the certain death of the Voting Rights Act as its provisions expire in a matter of months."

 Gingrich88.1.d:0 "In an official statement from the White House today, President Newt Gingrich announced a proposal for an amendment to the US Constitution that would enforce congressional term limits. Formerly a Republican representative from the 3rd district of Georgia in the House of Representatives, Gingrich’s influence on Capitol Hill is still large despite his office being moved to the White House. Subsequently, reports from the Hill confirm that a House resolution has been put forth, specifically setting term limits to two terms for members of the Senate and six terms for members of the House, both adding to twelve maximum years of service. The “term limit” movement in the United States is relatively new, and as this amendment must pass a joint session of Congress, it is unclear if many elected Senators and Representatives would be in favor of this amendment as it may result in some of them losing their offices. Early polling of the public, however, has suggested that many average Americans are satisfied with this announcement."
 Gingrich88.2.d:0 "In an unprecedented announcement at the White House today, President Newt Gingrich announced the signing of an executive order providing for the “efficient streamlining of the Department of State” by effectively cutting somewhere between 40-50% of the department’s staff, including members of the US Foreign Service, but mostly bureaucratic personnel located in Washington as well as non-essential personnel abroad.\n\nDecried by both sides of the aisle as an irresponsible move in US foreign policy, particularly during the tension-filled period of the Cold War, President Gingrich’s administration has largely remained silent on comments. It is known that the President, especially during his time in Congress, was not fond of foreign policy in general, but pundits are generally surprised by this, as well as thousands of federal government employees who were told they were being fired today."
 Gingrich88.3.d:0 "In an official statement from the White House today, President Newt Gingrich announced a proposal for an amendment to the US constitution that would abolish the Electoral College. Simultaneously introduced into the US House of Representatives, Gingrich’s amendment calls for the utilization of a plan similar to that of France, wherein the required threshold to win the presidency is 40% of the popular vote and if no candidate is able to win 40%, a runoff would be held. This would drastically alter the structure and functioning of the American political system, particularly as it allows more than two parties to compete in an election. A similar amendment had been proposed in the 1969-1970 session of Congress, but was defeated by Southern states who feared their influence would be taken away. It is entirely unclear whether that attitude has changed within Congress, but early polling on the public reveals mixed feelings, with most supporting the idea."
 Gingrich88.4.d:0 "An unusual proposal has made its way from the White House today as President Newt Gingrich reveals a new weapon in his fight against crime: orbiting mirrors. With some rather halfhearted assistance from the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the NASA Administrator, the Gingrich has released a proposal outlining the deployment of thousands of orbiting mirrors, designed to be maneuvered to harness light sources from the Sun, in order to provide ambient light over American cities at night. Further discussing this, Gingrich’s proposal makes the argument that less crime would be committed if metropolitan areas and highways were lit constantly. The media and public at large has seized onto this as yet another example of irresponsible spending, and this is sure to be a late-night punchline for the next few weeks. In an official statement, the White House makes no jokes, saying that with congressional approval it hopes to move forward with the plan with full force."

 Kemp88.1.d:0 "Today at a White House press conference, President Jack Kemp called for an amendment to the US Constitution requiring that the federal budget be balanced. Formerly a member of the House of Representatives for the district in and around Buffalo, New York, Kemp has repeatedly stressed his fiscal policies, particularly in his campaign, and with his influence among Republicans in the House, appears to have some chance of this amendment actually happening. Public reaction to this announcement has been generally positive, with organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union being supportive of Kemp’s proposal. It is unclear, however, if or when an amendment resolution will begin in Congress, but with pressure from the White House, it could be very soon."
 Kemp88.2.d:0 "Today from the Oval Office, flanked by his Secretaries of State and Commerce, President Jack Kemp announced to reporters his intention to establish a Pacific Free Trade Zone, composed of the United States and seven other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. While never done before, this is an unprecedented development, particularly with expanding economic growth in Asia. Public opinion on the matter is mixed, with most average Americans remaining generally apathetic on the subject, with the largest concern being available jobs and products. Many liberal internationalists, particularly those in Asia-Pacific affairs, welcome this development as a new step in the right direction for foreign trade and economic development."
 Kemp88.3.d:0 "Kemp sat in the Oval Office, flipping through his daily briefings, when his Secretary of State, Benjamin Gilman, stepped in. Another former House member from New York and a long-time member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Gilman was an excellent choice for Secretary of State, having worked in the United Nations and with efforts to free US prisoners of war abroad.\n\nTossing two manila folders on the Resolute Desk, Gilman shook hands with Kemp, asking how First Lady Joanne Kemp was. Looking down, Kemp saw the folders, looking back up, asking, “What’s this, Ben?”\n\n “Sir, those are proposals for free trade with Europe; either the EEC, or the EFTA. The Secretary of Commerce and US Trade Representative have also included their opinions.”\n\n “Excellent. Let’s talk. What are the costs and benefits?”\n\n “Well, sir, working with the European Economic Community would be the more obvious option, as it opens up trade with Germany, France, the UK, and southern Europe, but would face a lot of pressure and opposition from left-wing groups in those governments that see our trade policies as being further economic imperialism.”\n\nThe two men scoffed, almost simultaneously. Gilman continued.\n\n “However, we could go with the underdog. The European Free Trade Association is composed of more neutral European countries, including the Nordics and Switzerland, that have more liberal trading practices. We could tap into smaller markets and prop them up, with the implicit promise that they would have greater access to American products than the rest of the EEC.”\n\nKemp leaned back in his chair, thinking. “Ben, I’ll be honest with you, this is a tough decision, but I think we have to go with...""
 Kemp88.4.d:0 "The White House Press Secretary, as well as the State Department spokesman confirmed today that the Kemp Administration, in cooperation with the Departments of State, Commerce, and the US Trade Representative, intends to begin negotiations with the European Economic Community, or EEC, on a free trade deal. Preliminarily known as the US-EEC Free Trade Agreement, this proposed deal would eliminate all trade restrictions between the United States and members of the EEC, including the powerhouses of West Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Benelux countries. When reached for a statement, President of the European Commission Jacques Delors’ office came with a positive response, indicating a willingness to begin negotiations despite domestic pressures from left-wing parties in some member countries. American public opinion is high, with most foreign policy experts calling this a significant development in modern US-European affairs."
 Kemp88.5.d:0 "The White House Press Secretary, as well as the State Department spokesman confirmed today that the Kemp Administration, in cooperation with the Departments of State, Commerce, and the US Trade Representative, intends to begin negotiations with the European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, on a free trade deal. Preliminarily known as the American-EFTA Free Trade Agreement, this proposed deal would eliminate all trade restrictions between the United States and members of EFTA, including many neutral countries such as Switzerland and Austria as well as many Nordic countries such as Sweden. When reached for a statement, General Secretary of EFTA Georg Reisch responded positively, indicating surprise but some degree of willingness to proceed with negotiations, despite the announced neutrality of many EFTA members. American public opinion is mixed, with many wondering why the President chose smaller European countries as opposed to the more powerful EEC. Many foreign policy experts, however, still see large benefits in these negotiations and the future of American free trade to come."
