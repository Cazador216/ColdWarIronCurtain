 KOR_RAID.4.d:0 "A nation in crisis has been developed, as South Korea's president, Park Chung Hee, was assassinated at the hands of North Korean commandos. The attack, orchestrated by Unit 124, North Korea's most prized commando unit, successfully raided the Blue House, the presidential residence in South Korea, and eliminated Park without leaving a trace. In his permanent absence, Prime Minister Chung Il-kwon has been sworn in as the 7th president of the Republic of Korea. Observers point out that should South Korea be unable to create a proper response, it will leave itself vulnerable to a potential North Korean invasion."

 cambodia.2.d:0 "On January 17, 1968, the new communist militant group, the Khmer Rouge, led by the mysterious Pol Pot, launched a nation-wide communist insurgency across Cambodia. Guerrilla fighters, numbering only 4-5,000, have taken quite a portion of the countryside in the northern countryside alone, using the Jungle to their advantage. Already, Vietnam has shown support for the Khmer Rouge, supplying them with arms and training from fellow insurgents. The revolution came about after what can only be speculated to be years of preparation for the insurgency."
 Uganda.1.d:0 "On July 30th, 1953, Secretary of State for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton mentioned in passing the possibility of unification and federation of the British East Africa territories. This passing mention sparked stressed protest from the Ministers of Buganda, stating that they felt the idea of integration would destroy their culture and their way of life. Though Governor of Uganda, Sir Andrew Cohen, assured them that no decision would be made without consulting the Buganda, many political figures feel like the cat is out of the bag, and many more call for Bugandan independence." 
 Uganda.2.d:0 "As the Kebaka Crisis continues to spiral in Uganda, the British Colonial Administration has decided to exile the Bugandan King Mutesa II to silence his calls against the proposed East African Federation. While British authorities had hoped this would calm the situation it is appearing to have the opposite effect. Sir Cohen, the governor of Uganda had wanted a new monarch selected however Buganda is refusing to comply......"
 Uganda.3.d:0 "After being in exile for months, Mutesa II has returned to Uganda following the ratification of the Buganda Agreement amending the prior agreement from 1900. The agreement increased local African representation in the Ugandan Protectorate as well as preserving Buganda as an integral part of Uganda."
 cultural_events.4.d:0 "French writer, activist, and anticolonialist Jean-Paul Sartre has passed away from edema of the lung. Throughout his life, Sartre focused on the notion of human freedom and would eventually become a public intellectual following the war, actively calling for writers to express their political commitment. Sartre also took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. Over fifty thousand Parisians attended his funeral at Montparnasse Cemetery."
 Uganda.10.d:0 "King Mutesa II of Buganda has fled his home country of Uganda to the United Kingdom following accusations of high treason by Prime Minister Milton Obote. These accusations follow a series of political crises, including the Obote seizing presidential powers of Uganda from Mutesa earlier this week. Mutesa's objection to this seizure of power resulted in Obote sending troops to the king's residence on Mengo Hill to bring him the king, dead or alive. Though the king's bodyguards and the loyalists fought valiantly at the hill and in the streets, they were outgunned by the better armed soldiers. At the end of the battle, the palace was set on fire, with the king narrowly escaping during a sudden thunderstorm."
 Uganda.11.d:0 "Further turmoil in Uganda broke out today as Prime Minister Milton Obote announced a referendum over the status of two counties and whether or not they should remain part of the Kingdom of Buganda, be returned to the Kingdom of Bunyoro or to establish a new district. The Kingdom of Buganda sees this referendum as a direct assault on their autonomy. With the King of Buganda being the ceremonial President of Uganda more turmoil for this small African nation is likely soon to occur."
 Uganda.12.d:0 "Prime Minister Milton Obote has been executed by King Mutesa II of Buganda for high treason against the King of Buganda, following his own accusations that the king himself had committed high treason. These accusations follow a series of political crises, including the Obote seizing presidential powers of Uganda from Mutesa earlier this week. Mutesa's objection to this seizure of power resulted in Obote sending troops to the king's residence on Mengo Hill to bring him the king, dead or alive. Though the Obote's soldiers were much better armed than the king's bodyguards and the ragtag loyalists fighting street to street, their guerilla tactics and refusal to surrender resulted in a collapse of the rebellious offensive. The disgraceful prime minister was found trying to escape the capital in the trunk of a car, and was immediately brought to see the kings justice for his crimes."
 KPA_RAID.4.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the South Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. This came mere days after the successful assassination of the South Korean leader Park Chung Hee by Unit 124, North Korea's most prized commando unit. The United States of America, the chief ally of South Korea, has yet to make an official response to the declaration of war, but reports circulate that the US garrison stationed within the Seoul Metropolitan Area have already left the vicinity, preparing to reinforce the DMZ which has already seen significant amounts of skirmishes never before seen since the Korean War. President Chung Il-kwon and his cabinet have already evacuated the area to an undisclosed location, with the residents of Seoul, Inchon, and other major cities within the area evacuating themselves to the southern provinces of the Republic. North Korea's main allies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, have also yet to respond, but observers predict that China will most likely respond the most and the fastest, with the Soviet Union intervening as a last resort should it be necessary."
 KPA_RAID_ALT.4.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the North Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. Already, thousands of soldiers from the KPA have been deployed to the DMZ, and sleeper agents of North Korea have been activated, sabotaging South Korea's ability to mount a proper response. This was a result of a successful assassination attempt against President Park Chung Hee orchestrated by Unit 124, North Korea's elite commando force. Seeing the inability to protect the DMZ and its surrounding provinces, the US garrison in Seoul have already evacuated and taken up defensive positions in both Busan and Jeju, endangering millions of South Korean citizens in the face of North Korea. While North Korea's major allies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, have yet to respond, it is highly predicted that China will mobilize its troops to assist their communist ally to strengthen its influence in Asia, with the Soviets intervening if necessary."
 KPA_RAID.5.d:0 "North Korea has disclosed that their leader, Kim Il-Sung, is dead. This is surprising for the isolated nation, and even more surprising is that the North Korean leader died from gunshot wounds in what they claim is a South Korean assassination. It is believed this assassination is South Korea's retaliation to North Korea's assassination attempt on Park Chung Hee, the South Korean leader. According to South Korean insiders, the Air Force's special forces Unit 684 carried out the attack. Such an attack is unprecedented on the Korean peninsula, and observers predict a major military conflict to break out soon."
 KPA_RAID.2:0 "Disaster and embarrassment has struck South Korea today as both the Korean Central News Agency, the propaganda arm of North Korea, along with insider sources have reported that South Korea has failed to assassinate Kim Il-Sung of North Korea in retaliation for North Korea's attempts to assassinate President Park Chung Hee of South Korea. The special forces unit assigned to this task, Unit 684 of the ROK Air Force, are now facing criminal charges in North Korea, with some experts stating that it is merely a show trial, and that it will inevitably end with either their execution, or torture for information. In response, the KCNA has declared that North Korea will use all available methods to \"destroy America and her South Korean puppet state, and liberate the Korean people from their yolk\". Mere hours after the report, the American garrison in Seoul is put on high alert, with Washington considering increasing the garrison force substantially in the face of a potential large scale military conflict in the Peninsula."
 iran_assasinations.1.d:0 "Royal Minister Abdolhossein Hazhir was pronounced dead with three gunshot wounds to the head while praying at Sepahsalar Mosque. While many did not agree with his support of the British in the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, his death has sent shockwaves across the Iranian government and population. Many quickly turn the blame to Fada'iyan-e Islam, who have long protested against Hazhir and the high positions he found himself in. His assassin, Seyyed Hossein Emami Esfahani was found to be part of the organization soon after capture. Unrest has sprung up across Tehran, with fundamentalists and those who oppose them taking to the streets in conflict. This may be the start of a greater crisis..."
 dmz_conflict.100.d:0 "Ever since the signing of the armistice agreement, North and South Korea are supposedly enjoying a period of peace, free from conflict that would've otherwise spilled more blood in a region filled with death and destruction since the start of the 20th Century. However, this is far from the truth. Ever since the armistice agreement, occasional border skirmishes run rampant throughout the DMZ, where soldiers of the KPA and the ROK Army, along with the US garrison stationed there, are often attacking each other, with inconclusive results. This indirectly shows the flaws of the armistice agreement, in that it merely creates a temporary and symbolic peace in the Korean Peninsula."
 dmz_conflict.101.d:0 "It has been more than 4 years since the border skirmishes and occasional incursions had started in the Korean Peninsula, with both parties attempting to gain territory and push their borders past the DMZ to gain a strategic advantage against the opposing party. Due to the unsuccessful attacks and counter attacks done by both Koreas, observers deduce that the DMZ conflict has effectively ended with an inconclusive result, as both parties still have their borders by the 38th parallel. While this is a result that neither parties would want to accept, the decrease in frequency of border skirmishes have proven that both parties have withdrawn and lost interest in continuing the conflict, and focus on their internal issues that plagues their respective nations, effectively bringing temporary peace in the peninsula once more."
 dmz_conflict.102.d:0 "It has been more than 4 years since the border skirmishes and occasional incursions had started in the Korean Peninsula, with both parties attempting to gain territory and push their borders past the DMZ to gain a strategic advantage against the opposing party. Due to the North's extensive use of guerilla warfare and its proven success against the US backed South Korea, North Korea has undoubtedly won the DMZ conflict, with observers agreeing with such statement. However, the same observers call such victory as unprecedented, and believe that North Korea may try its luck and potentially bring about full scale military conflict against South Korea."
 dmz_conflict.103.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the North Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. Already, thousands of soldiers from the KPA have been deployed to the DMZ, and sleeper agents of North Korea have been activated, sabotaging South Korea's ability to mount a proper response. This was a result of successful incursions by North Korea into their southern neighbor's territory, reaching as far as the city limits of Seoul. Seeing the inability to protect the DMZ and its surrounding provinces, the US garrison in Seoul have already evacuated and taken up defensive positions in both Busan and Jeju, endangering millions of South Korean citizens in the face of North Korea. While North Korea's major allies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, have yet to respond, it is highly predicted that China will mobilize its troops to assist their communist ally to strengthen its influence in Asia, with the Soviets intervening if necessary."
