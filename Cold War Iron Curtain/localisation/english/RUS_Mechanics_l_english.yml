 RUS_Crisis_End.0.d:0 "After an arduous week and six days of a brutal power struggle between parliament, and increasingly hostile rioters, President Boris Yeltsin has defied all odds, and managed to solidify his grip on power, and has brought a crushing end to the ensuing political crisis in the fledgling Russian Federation. While it's hard to definitively say where Yeltsin will steer the country, it's abundantly clear that Russia will be stable enough to meet any direction Yeltsin takes. While the international community has yet to comment about the end of the crisis, many watch with expectantly with baited breath."
 RUS_Crisis_End.1.d:0 "With the dissolution of the Soviet Union a mere two years ago, the political turmoil and chaos seems to have reached the Russian government itself, as Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin has officially been impeached, with vice president, Alexander Rutskoy set to replace him. Despite this impeachment, it's clear Yeltsin refuses to simply accept this ruling, and will likely fight his impeachment with all the power at his disposal. While it's unclear if this impeachment will escalate to a wider reaching crisis, it is certainly likely."
 RUS_Crisis_End.2.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the once established Russian president, it seems it was for naught, as the parliament has succeeded in removing Boris Yeltsin from his seat of power, with Alexander Rutskoy ascending to the position of President in his place. Despite Yeltsin's devastating defeat, and the growing calls for blood amongst the Russian people, Yeltsin is nowhere to be found. While Russian authorities are likely to expend all available resources to track the former president down, it's unclear if they've fled the country or not. Despite the clear set back, and growing disappointment at the inability to serve justice to the former President, the worst of the crisis is over, and Russia can finally begin her recovery."
 RUS_Crisis_End.3.d:0 "Despite Yeltsin, and Russian authorities' best efforts, the anger, and radicalisation of the Russian people has only continued to rise, reaching an absolute boiling point today as reports of rioters storming the Kremlin in mass have reached international ears. While the exact details of how the rioters managed to breach Kremlin security, and what their intentions were in storming the Kremlin are still unknown. What is known however, is that Yeltsin, if not the main target, was quite clearly in the crossfire, as his security was overwhelmed as Yeltsin soon found himself at the mercy of the Russian people, who by now have grown completely disillusioned with his rule. Almost like a snapshot back to the 19th century, the Russian people have hung former President Yeltsin by the neck near the Moscow Zoo. While the barbaric actions of the rioters have met international condemnation, the future of Russia, and its international standing is now more unknown than ever before."
 RUS_Crisis_End.4.d:0 "With Russia's constitutional crisis finally at an end, with the increasingly hated former President Yeltsin finally impeached, and stripped of authority, Vice President Alexander Rutskoy has officially, publicly inaugurated as Russia's second President. While the political direction of Rutskoys presidency is still relatively unknown, as is the fate of Russia's relationship with the western world, many look on with optimism. Many Russian's, and people abroad hope Rutskoys presidency will bring further political liberalization, and hope he will bring the much needed stability Russia is desperate for in the wake of the late Constitutional Crisis. Yet, as of now, however, the international community can only watch with bated breath."

 #Russian Political Events
 RUS_90s.1.d:0 "The Congress of People's Deputies made a historic announcement today, declaring that Russian laws now held supremacy over Soviet laws. This declaration officially made Russia a nominally independent state, similar to other Soviet republics that had achieved sovereignty earlier. This announcement was made due to the Soviet government's inability to implement reforms that could have prevented the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Following this declaration, there were discussions about a new union treaty that would be signed to reorganize the Soviet Union. Russian Premier, Boris Yeltsin, expressed his willingness to work with the existing Soviet government for more liberalization and reforms to be implemented within Russia itself and the Soviet Union as a whole. This announcement is seen as a significant step towards the eventual disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Russia as a separate nation."
 RUS_90s.2.d:0 "On this historic day, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, a prominent figure in Soviet politics, has been declared the President of Russia. This marks the first-ever free presidential election in the country's entire history. The inauguration ceremony was attended by over a thousand reformers who had gathered within the Congress of People's Deputies to witness this momentous occasion. Yeltsin's victory can be attributed to his charismatic personality and his unwavering commitment to freeing Russia from the shackles of a communist regime. His vision of a free and democratic Russia deeply resonated with the electorate, which led to his resounding victory in the election. While the President of the Soviet Union has extended congratulations to Yeltsin on his victory, it is worth noting that public awareness of Gorbachev's animosity towards Yeltsin raises questions about the sincerity of this announcement. Despite this, Yeltsin's supporters remain optimistic about the future of Russia under his leadership."
 RUS_90s.3.d:0 "The recent news has confirmed that Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov, who previously served as the Premier of the Soviet Union, has been elected as the President of Russia. It was widely speculated that Ryzhkov would become the next President, as he was the preferred candidate of the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union. While the President of the Soviet Union congratulated Ryzhkov on his new office, Ryzhkov himself seemed to reject the endorsement from the General Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev. In fact, he was quoted as saying that "The General Secretary's words are nothing". However, Ryzhkov's opponent, Boris Yeltsin, has publicly denounced Ryzhkov's Presidency. Yeltsin has claimed that the Soviet media had a bias towards Ryzhkov and that they didn't promote his campaign as much as they should have. He has called for a review of the election results and is urging the authorities to overturn the decision."
 RUS_90s.4.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky, has been elected as the new President of RSFSR. Although his affiliation with the ruling CPSU has led to widespread speculation that he is merely a puppet candidate, Zhirinovsky's recent move to posthumously rehabilitate the Tsar and his family has proven to be a contentious move, drawing criticism from the hardliners of the Communist Party. Despite his reputation for extremist and unhinged views, Zhirinovsky has managed to rise to the top of Russia's political institutions. His ascent to the presidency has been met with a mix of curiosity and trepidation, as the world watches to see what his next moves will be. Many are eagerly anticipating his first official address as President, hoping for some indication of his vision for the future of Russia and its place in the global community. The Russian population, on the other hand, has largely dismissed Zhirinovsky as a figure of ridicule. However, with his recent election, they are now forced to confront the possibility that his views may have more influence than they initially thought. As such, Zhirinovsky's presidency is likely to be a source of intense scrutiny and debate, both within Russia and beyond."
 RUS_90s.5.d:0 "The Russian political landscape was sent into a shock today as the 4th Vice President of Russia, Boris Nemtsov was found dead after visiting his dacha in Saint Petersburg. President Vladimir Putin has commenced a full-scale investigation and has declared that the perpetrator will be executed without trial for the barbaric attack. Movladi Baisarov, a Chechen warlord is the initial suspect in the murder, which was affirmed by his statement on the issue. President Putin has now appointed Prime Minister Mikhail Khodorkovsky as the acting Vice President of the Russian Federation."
 RUS_90s.6.d:0 "In the wake of the dissolution of the State Duma and the banning of the Communist Party, President Gorbachev has taken another bold step and dissolved the Chernomyrdin Cabinet. This move is seen as an attempt to undermine all forms of Yeltsin influence in the government. In replacing the previous cabinet, President Gorbachev has appointed Boris Titov, a relatively unknown figure, as the new Prime Minister. In his address, Titov has announced the formation of a new cabinet, which includes several notable figures such as Ella Pamfilova as the Minister of Internal Affairs, Sergey Lavrov as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yuri Skuratov as the Minister of Defence, Aleksandr Bortnikov as the Head of FSB, Nikolay Kharitonov as the Minister of Agriculture, Anatoly Sobchak as the Minister of Justice, and Sergey Baburin as the Minister of Economy. This new cabinet is expected to bring some much-needed stability to the Russian government and help the country navigate through these turbulent times."
 RUS_90s.7.d:0 "There has been a recent development in the political scene of Russia. Gennady Zyuganov, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, has been imprisoned by the government under the leadership of Gorbachev. This move has caused a stir among the supporters of the banned CPRF, leading to an escalation of anti-government protests and attacks. Zyuganov, who has been a prominent figure in the Russian political landscape, has been accused of treason and betrayal of the state by the government. As a result, his properties have been seized by the authorities. In response to his imprisonment and the banning of the CPRF, Zyuganov has called for a Second Revolution against the Gorbachev-led government. This has further fueled the unrest and instability in the country. "
 RUS_90s.8.d:0 "The President of Russia, Alexander Rutskoy, has appointed Ruslan Khasbulatov as the new Vice President, following the resignation of the previous Vice President, Anatoly Sobchak. The President personally selected Khasbulatov for the role, citing his experience as the former Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. However, some commentators have suggested that Khasbulatov's appointment is more a result of his close relationship with the President, as they both opposed Yeltsin during the constitutional crisis. Additionally, the President's decision to appoint Khasbulatov may also be viewed as a move away from liberal politicians in the Russian Federation who are against the Special Military Operation. Overall, Khasbulatov's appointment is seen as a strike against the liberal faction in the country."
 RUS_90s.9.d:0 "In a stunning and unexpected move, the President of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Gorbachev, made an announcement regarding the dissolution of the State Duma. Apparently, this decision was made due to the parliament's inability to enact Gorbachev's policies. Moreover, the attempted impeachment of President Gorbachev also played a role in this move. Many western political critics have called this move a "backsliding" of Russia's new democratic institutions. President Gorbachev has also called for a new Parliamentary election to be held within months after the dissolution. It is expected that Gorbachev will also call for the banning of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation since the party has vehemently opposed President Gorbachev's policies and leadership."
 RUS_90s.10.d:0 "Despite being one of the most prominent republics within the Soviet Union, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) has yet to establish its own regional national anthem. In fact, it stands as the only republic within the Soviet Union that lacks one - a fact that has spurred the Congress of People's Deputies into action.\n\nIn response to this oversight, the Congress has put forth several candidates for consideration as Russia's own national anthem. The hope is that by creating a unique and representative anthem for the RSFSR, the region can establish a stronger sense of identity and pride among its citizens.\n\nWhile the selection process is ongoing, the importance of a national anthem cannot be understated. It serves as a symbol of a nation's values, history, and cultural identity, and can evoke powerful emotions in those who hear it. As such, the Congress is taking great care to ensure that whichever anthem is ultimately chosen fully embodies the spirit of Russia and its people."
 RUS_90s.11.d:0 "In response to the Communist-dominated State Duma and the unpopular President Yeltsin, Russia's Yabloko party and other small fringe parties have joined hands to form a powerful coalition called "The Third Bloc". With a significant number of seats in government institutions, this alliance intends to challenge the existing political order and bring about a much-needed change. The bloc has also announced its plan to field a candidate in the upcoming 1996 Russian Presidential election, although the identity of the candidate remains unknown. This move is expected to shake up the political landscape and provide voters with an alternative to the established parties."
 RUS_90s.12.d:0 "In a sudden and astonishing development, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has been announced as the new President of Russia. Gorbachev, who was initially thought to be a candidate just for laughs, managed to turn the tables on his political rivals after Yavlinsky and Lebedev agreed to nominate him on the Third Bloc platform. Gorbachev has promised to undo the damaging effects of Yeltsin's radical market reforms and reintroduce some form of socialist democracy in the institutions of Russia. This is a significant turn of events, and many are curious to see how Gorbachev will navigate the complex political landscape of the country."
 RUS_90s.13.d:0 "Former Mayor of Saint Petersburg, Vladimir Putin, who resigned from his job due to his opposition to Rutskoy invasion of Ukraine and Kazakhstan has been named the 3rd President of Russia's, following what the West called a "rigged election" Vladimir Putin narrowly won with (percentage here) of votes, he vowed to end the war, pull Russia troops from Ukraine and Kazakhstan and reestablish normal relationship with the west.\n\nThe Central Election Committee has commissioned an investigation for possible fraud in the election."
