 # Sri Lankan Civil War
 CIA_SRL.0.d:0 "SRI LANKAN INSURGENCY: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn recent years, tensions between the Sri Lankan Government, dominated by the Sinhalese ethnic group, and the Tamil ethnic group, located in the north of the country, have escalated into violence. Tamils have alleged systemic discrimination against them in employment, education, and language, particularly concerning the 1970s policy of standardization which systematically limited Tamil students from gaining entrance into universities. (U/OU)\n\nThe Tamil opposition to government policy has existed in the form of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), acting as the legitimate political opposition since 1976; while militant groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been formed under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran. Both groups, while differing in their methods, desire for the creation of a secular, socialist state of “Tamil Eelam” located in the Tamil-majority north of the country. (S)\n\nRecent anti-Tamil riots and demonstrations, including one in 1977 that resulted in 125 deaths, and the burning of the Jaffna Public Library in 1981 by a Sinhalese mob, have continually increased tensions towards full civil war. Now, in 1983, the fire has begun to burn bright, particularly after a Sri Lankan Army patrol, known as “Four Four Bravo” was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. The period known as “Black July”, has resulted in multiple anti-Tamil pogroms, massacres of prisoners, and hundreds of deaths. (S)\n\nIt is estimated that the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups will continue to harass and outright fight Sri Lankan Army units. However, the situation is unclear outside of Sri Lanka; the influence of India in the conflict is unknown, although the presence of a sizable Tamil population in southern India may present obstacles to the Sri Lankan Government in putting down this uprising. (S)"
 CIA_SRL.1.d:0 "INDIA’S POSITION ON SRI LANKA: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIndia’s relative geopolitical position to Sri Lanka has presented significant issues to the Sri Lankan Government in its attempt to counter the insurgency by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). With Sri Lanka and India being only 35 miles apart from each other at their closest points, and the appearance of a significant Tamil population in southern India, it is our assessment that the Indian Government will attempt some measure of involvement in the conflict, likely on the side of the Tamil insurgents. (S)\n\nTamil groups, both in Sri Lanka, and in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, have developed strong relationships and cooperation. Specifically, the LTTE has developed relationships with officials from the Pure Tamil Movement and the Kamaraj Congress, as well as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G. Ramachandran, a prominent state official. (S)\n\nThe United States is faced with a challenge in responding to this conflict, and subsequent Indian involvement. It is clear that constraining Indian influence in the region is vital to ensuring that the Sri Lankan Government can continue its counterinsurgency operations unabated. The following are recommendations that can be taken to destabilize Indian influence in the region and take pressure off of Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Using the resources of the International Monetary Fund and other economic organizations to end loan access to the Indian Government\n\n2. Organizing Tamil-majority emigre groups on the Indian mainland, with the intent of forming militant organizations similar to the LTTE in Sri Lanka.\n\n3. Using diplomatic channels to pressure Pakistan into ceasing aid to the Sri Lankan Government, as well as beginning arms shipments to Indian Tamil militant groups.\n\nIt is our hope that this analysis and recommendation will effectively end Indian influence in the region, turn New Delhi’s focus away from their island neighbor, and allow a continuance of the status quo in the area."
 CIA_SRL.2.d:0 "As the Secretary of the Treasury walked into the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund, he was glad that it was so close. Only a short car ride away from the Treasury office buildings, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, it made visits like this simple, and easy, not requiring a flight and more importantly, press.\n\nOnly a few sets of stairs and an elevator ride, and the Secretary was sitting in the office of the Managing Director, the Frenchman Jacques de Larosiere, the most powerful man in the IMF. As the United States representative of the Board of Governors, the Secretary knew he had much influence on the operations of the IMF globally. Having thought over the contents of the CIA report he had read earlier, he knew what was required now.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Secretary. What can I do for you?” de Larosiere leaned back, setting down a cup of coffee on a saucer at his desk, with a view of the DC skyline behind him.\n\n“Jacques, you and I have known each other for a long time. Your leadership at the French Treasury, and now at the IMF, has been excellent. I need a favor from you.” The Secretary adjusted himself as he continued.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen the news or read the briefings from your government. India is increasingly getting involved in the Sri Lankan Civil War, funding the Communist Tamil rebels in the north. They are intentionally sabotaging the conflict and are costing millions of lives in the balance. We recommend that the IMF take action to sanction India for its actions and force them to take pressure off of Sri Lanka.”\n\n“Mr. Secretary. What exactly is your government proposing we do? India is also a consenting member of the IMF. I don’t see why we should get involved in this issue.”“Mr. de Larosiere, you are the Managing Director, the most powerful person in this organization. Our government proposes cutting off access to IMF loans to India. This would not require a vote and could just simply be a procedural matter that you implement, quietly. No press, no scandal, no nothing. It would mean a lot to us, Jacques.”\n\nde Larosiere paused. “Fine, Mr. Secretary. I will see what we can do to end loan access, but no promises. The IMF wants no blowback from this."
 CIA_SRL.3.d:0 "We have received a notification from the International Monetary Fund that our access to IMF loans has been revoked, on the basis of “not following certain criteria for members seeking loans.” While presenting a massive challenge to our fiscal and international economic situation, the Government suspects this may be a move by the IMF, and by the Western bloc as a whole, to sanction our actions in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is unclear how we should respond, other than categorically condemning this action and requesting the IMF reverse its decision. Some figures in our Government have suggested tapering back actions in Sri Lanka, as a means of appeasing the West, but others have maintained the need for self-determination on issues such as these."
 CIA_SRL.4.d:0 "As Jayamravi sat in the small restaurant, he looked around, between the door and his table, to the kitchen, and back again. As he set down the Tamil-language newspaper he was reading, he saw the two men approaching his table, nodding as they sat down. Jayamravi launched straight in.\n\n“I assume you two are here because you’re interested in the local Tiger unit?” He spoke in a hushed tone. The two nodded.\n\nLooking around, Jayamravi stood up, picking up his newspaper, leaving a few rupees on the table, and walking out into the dusty, crowded streets of Madurai, then turning suddenly into an alley, ducking into another alley, and stopping outside a doorway where a man stood. Jayamravi nodded, motioned for the two men to follow, and guided them inside, where a makeshift command center and armory seemed to have been set up.\n\n“Welcome to the local cell of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu, gentlemen. Our fighters have done checks on you and have determined that you are safe. Welcome abroad. We’re glad to have you.” Jayamravi smiled, gesturing to the tables, spread with maps, newspapers, a desk in the back with vests, explosives about to be strapped to them. Jayamravi unholstered a pistol, checking the slide. “I hope you know what you’re getting into.”\n\nWhat no one but only one realized was that “Jayamravi” was really an elaborate cover. CIA operative Shekar smiled. He missed his home, a wonderful suburbia outside of McLean, Virginia, but this mission was far more important. Much more had to be done."
 CIA_SRL.5.d:0 "SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMilitant activity among Tamil nationalist and militant groups has been steadily increasing in the state of Tamil Nadu, including in the major cities of Chennai, Puducherry, and Madurai. The most prominent has probably been the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a militant group almost identically based off of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nIt is not currently known of the connection between the Sri Lanka-based LTTE and the LTTN; however, it can be assumed that connections have taken place. The LTTN primarily operates as an Indian affiliate of the Tamil Tigers, designed to operate in Tamil-majority areas in an attempt to alienate popular support away from current Government assistance to the LTTE.\n\nThe current recommendation of this report is to move forward with basic counter-insurgency operations and heavier policing operations to prevent LTTN cells from committing incursions or other terrorist attacks on sovereign Indian soil. The state of Tamil Nadu should receive all adequate funding and resources necessary to achieve this task."
 CIA_SRL.6.d:0 "DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS TOWARDS INDIA\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBased on our previous assessments, this Office has indicated that instead of further destabilization operations towards India, a change in strategy is required, towards covert diplomatic actions. This office provides the following recommendations, with the cooperation of the US Embassy, New Delhi; and the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Department of State:\n\n1. Covert pressure and threatening to withhold aid, including military aid in the form of possible arms sales and technology transfers, as well as direct economic aid.\n\n2. Placing pressure on US companies operating in India, such as Union Carbide India Limited, to make similar demands, on the basis that India should cease their actions in Sri Lanka if they would like to continue to maintain economic cooperation and growth with US and other Western companies.\n\n3. Working with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to consider placing sanctions and seizing assets of prominent Indian officials, including Cabinet officials, members of the Defense Staff, and personnel at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, on similar basis as stated above.\n\n4. Enforcement of all above sanctions and threats, as well as ensuring support from allies and other Western nations in placing pressure on the Indian Government.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that these recommendations will provide adequate diplomatic weight to persuade India to cease their operations and interference in Sri Lanka."
 CIA_SRL.7.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has come to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Inter-Services Intelligence, to request that we end aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their fight against the communist and Indian-backed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nAmerican officials are apparently focused on halting Indian influence in the region, particularly surrounding Sri Lanka, and have come to us, aware of our feelings towards India, and have asked for us to pursue more direct involvement, in order to perhaps take the Indians’ attention away from the island to the south.\n\nMembers of the Government are unsure about stopping arms shipments to the Sri Lankan Government, and some have argued that we can do both. However, we are dependent on US arms sales and other assistance, and listening to their requests may help us out in the long run."
 CIA_SRL.8.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley, and the State Department, that the Pakistani Government, including Inter-Services Intelligence, intends on continuing aid to the Sri Lankan Government in the form of arms sales and training of military personnel.\n\nWhile this is not what we asked the Pakistanis to do, and while there is some considerable anger in Langley as a result, the continued funding of the Sri Lankan Government by Pakistan still represents a beneficial opportunity to subvert Indian influence via proxy. We can only hope that their rhetoric towards India will toughen in the future."
 CIA_SRL.9.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley that after confidential discussions, the Pakistani Government, under the auspices of Inter-Service Intelligence, has agreed to end covert military aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their counterinsurgency operations against Tamil rebels.\n\nBased on a request from Langley, the Pakistanis have not taken back their physical military shipments, but have stopped them in the future. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to deal with the blowback from the Sri Lankan Government, with our support.\n\nIt is hoped that with this development, we shall be able to further persuade the Pakistanis to refocus their attention on their border with India and inflaming tensions in the Kashmir region, in order to turn the Indians’ attention away from Sri Lanka and back towards their archnemesis, Pakistan."
 CIA_SRL.10.d:0 "TAMIL NADU: POSSIBILITIES FOR OPERATIONS\nStation Chief, New Delhi; Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the United States’ endeavor to assist Sri Lanka in its ongoing civil war, it has become necessary to undertake more escalatory actions in order to prevent India from becoming further involved on the side of the Tamil rebels.\n\nCIA personnel in New Delhi and Colombo have proposed expansion of operations in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which is the closest state to Sri Lanka and contains a Tamil-majority population. This Office believes that the demographic distribution presents a vital factor in committing attacks there, as it will alienate Tamil Indians away from the war, and turn regional public opinion against the Indian-backed LTTE rebels.\n\nCommitting attacks in major cities of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Madurai, using the resources of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), against particular targets such as:\n\n-Pro-war Lok Sahka members,\n-Tamil Nadu state officials,\n-The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n-Prominent social and religious leaders in the state\n\nThis will effectively attract the attention of the Indian central government, distract law enforcement and security forces, and create social divisions between members of the Tamil majority."
 CIA_SRL.11.d:0 "TAMIL NADU SECURITY REPORT\n\nPrime Minister’s Office\n\nThe security situation in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has been contentious in recent weeks. Several attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a Tamil nationalist militant group heavily associated with the Sri Lankan LTTE, have been perpetrated in the major metropolitan areas of Chennai and Madurai.\n\nWhile no major state or central government officials have been killed or injured, the primary targets have been local municipal officials, as well as local police and members of the Tamil Nadu Police. However, intelligence sources indicate that attacks on Lok Sakha and state officials may be incoming, if the government does not act to stop their actions.\n\nLTTN attacks, much like their comrades in Sri Lanka, have focused on suicide attacks using bombs, as well as some limited shooting attacks. Many attacks appear to be pre-planned, indicating that LTTN cells have some knowledge of government and law enforcement operations before they happen.\n\nSome officials in the government have indicated their worry for this situation, particularly as it relates to our involvement in Sri Lanka. Some whisperings have echoed about withdrawal of Indian aid to the LTTE, on the basis that their affiliate organization is waging attacks on the mainland."
 CIA_SRL.12.d:0 "ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA: SUMMARY\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe United States’ decision to support the Sri Lankan Government in its ongoing civil conflict against the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or “Tamil Tigers”) has come with significant costs and benefits to both sides. This Office recommends the following actions in addition to regular diplomatic actions, as a means of reinforcing Sri Lanka’s military capability and effectiveness, as well as halting Indian involvement in the conflict on the side of the LTTE.\n\n1. The immediate implementation of intelligence sharing with the Sri Lankan military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in addition to the Sri Lankan Police Service and other security forces. This will ensure more accurate targeting and hopeful prevention of further terrorist attacks and incursions by LTTE and other Tamil militant groups.\n\n2. Coordination of covert support (lethal and non-lethal) with Pakistan, who has also been active in aiding the Sri Lankan Government\n\n 3. Consideration of additional lethal aid support to the Sri Lankan Government, including training of the Sri Lankan Special Forces Regiment, and lethal aid to government-backed paramilitary groups, including the Muslim Home Guard.\n\nIt is our hope that a combination of this aid will augment the struggling Sri Lankan military and security forces at this present time and increase their counterinsurgency capabilities as they continue to repel attacks and offensives from the LTTE."
 CIA_SRL.13.d:0 "As the Sri Lankan Army major sat in the command headquarters, outside of Colombo, he was sweating, both from the heat and from the nervousness he felt. Assigned to command the security detail for this divisional headquarters, he looked around, into the muggy night. It was quiet, too quiet. As he stepped out of the tent, he saw the barbed wire, the entrance gate, the guard towers flanked with young soldiers, armed with their machine guns. They had been terrorized by Tiger suicide bombings, something the major had never seen before. Security was tight, but never tight enough for them, he thought.\n\nAs he walked back into the tent, he peered over the latest reports, from the local army military intelligence officers. They were remarkably short and useless, providing little to no detail on the Tigers’ activities other than that they exist and continue to commit attacks. He sighed, wondering what the point of the military intelligence corps was. Surely they had to be intelligent, right? Apparently not.\n\nOne of his lieutenants, having sped in on a motorcycle, rushed in, carrying a sheaf of papers in a file. Messily saluting, he exhaustedly pushed the papers toward the major, who opened the file and starting looking through, trying to decipher the awful Sinhalese translation.\n\n“Sir, the American operative embedded with the Military Intelligence Corps has a report on the Tigers’ movements here. He’s warning of an attack tonight, using a truck.” The major looked around, then back down, reading the report.\n\n“Okay. Raise the alert level. Double the guards. Bring up the gate barriers. Tell the troops to prepare for an incurs-” He was interrupted by the sudden rip of automatic weapons fire, seemingly from the outer perimeter, followed by shouts as troops moved towards the skirmish. The major looked out at a truck, stopped, soldiers shooting at it, then moving forward, the gunshots stopping, the driver dead. He looked at his lieutenant, then down at the sheaf of papers. “Holy shit.”"
 CIA_SRL.14.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a possible new ally in the fight for Sri Lanka. Pakistan.” CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] stood in the Oval, surrounded by Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Secretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef], and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv].\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] sat at the Resolute Desk, listening. “Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, Mr. President, the Pakistanis have been covertly funding the Sri Lankan Government since the Civil War kicked off in July of ‘83. As our reports have indicated, the Indians have been funding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil rebels that the government in Colombo is fighting. The Pakistanis have long been foes of India, and have been using this conflict as an opportunity to exercise influence in the region in order to subvert Indian goals.”\n\nThe Secretary of Defense cut in. “Specifically, the Pakistanis have been providing the Sri Lankans with small arms, some explosives, and light patrol vehicles. Their Inter-Services Intelligence service has been providing some limited intelligence, but we think that combining arms transfers from us and intelligence sharing would heavily benefit the Sri Lankans in their fight.”\n\nThe President looked around. “I see no problem with this. What are the chances the Indians find out?”\n\nThe Secretary of State responded. “Our embassy in New Delhi, as well as the CIA chief of station there, have made inquiries discreetly. The Indians have no idea and are preoccupied with tensions in Kashmir as well as funding the Tigers in Sri Lanka.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Excellent. Make it happen, gentlemen. Reach out to the Pakistanis.” The men nodded, as they shook hands, wrote some notes, and left the room to make calls."
 CIA_SRL.15.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed our operatives at Inter-Services Intelligence that the United States is preparing to coordinate covert support to Sri Lanka, in the form of covert arms shipments, intelligence sharing, reconnaissance photos, and diplomatic actions.\n\nAs the US has noticed our help to the Sri Lankan Government, in their fight against Indian-backed Tamil rebels, they have decided to consolidate covert aid to maintain a united front and expand US-Pakistan cooperation. CIA and US military officials are expected to meet with ISI and Air Force officers in the coming days to work out details of a joint US-Pakistan arms shipment network, via air drops as well as cross-sea transfers via ship.\n\nIt is expected that this endeavor will be successful, with the hope that the Indians do not find out our partnership with the Americans."
 CIA_SRL.16.d:0 "FALSE FLAGS IN SRI LANKA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite the ongoing Sri Lankan Civil War, embedded CIA personnel and Sri Lankan Army personnel report a significant drop in combat effectiveness among government forces in recent weeks, out of a lack of morale and a lack of initiative among combat commanders, as well as continuing LTTE attacks on government installations and public buildings. This drop in morale is resulting in continued lack of initiative and therefore, further reduced morale.\n\nThis Office proposes the following recommendations to alleviate this issue and in particular, in ways that do not involve further advising the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, due to the lack of effectiveness with that strategy:\n\n1. Beginning covert support for isolated Tiger cells and other Sri Lankan rebel groups, with the specific mission of committing attacks against Sri Lankan government forces, under specific parameters determined by CIA operatives on the ground.\n\n2. Funding or otherwise supporting possible attacks against significant government buildings in Colombo, as well as against the residences of the Sri Lankan President, Sri Lankan Prime Minister, members of the Sri Lankan Parliament, and significant religious or social figures.\n\n3. Otherwise encouraging “false-flag” type attacks in order to provide the Sri Lankan Government with adequate justification to ramp up operations towards the LTTE forces to the north of the island.\n\nWhile no specific operations have been proposed by this Office, instead leaving that decision to be made by operatives on the ground, these should provide a basic structure to develop specific plans."
 CIA_SRL.17.d:0 "As the 2-ton truck rumbled and bounced down the road, the two drivers kept looking around, anxiously, checking the road, the sides, their rear, for figures poking out of the jungle undergrowth.\n\nThe truck had a red cross on it, indicating they were aid workers, as did their papers, but the drivers knew they were anything but. Presumably, this drive towards Mullaitivu, a town in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, would be somewhat safe, but the “aid workers” still carried concealed pistols, just in case. You could never be too careful.\n\nBouncing along, the truck stopped at what appeared to be a Tiger checkpoint. Mullaitivu was a government stronghold but the route they were taking was still contested, and that seemed clear as they got out of the truck, hands in the air, being searched by the guards, who patted them down while others stood by with Type 56 rifles. Apparently satisfied by their papers, they opened the makeshift checkpoint and the truck carried on, towards Mullaitivu, a few rupees lighter.\n\nReaching the town, the agents waved to the Sri Lankan soldiers, who looked at them warily. Arriving at the local mosque, the truck stopped, with the two men getting out and stretching for a moment before opening the back of the truck. These were certainly “aid supplies” if you considered aid to be several hundred rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The men nodded as members of the community came around, and one of them talked to the leader, apparently of the “Muslim Home Guard,” who started handing out the weapons. The other man climbed back into the truck, hitting the radio.\n\n“Eagle One to HQ. Baby birds have been fed. Distributing the “bird seed” now.”"
 CIA_SRL.18.d:0 "A dispatch from local Army commanders in Mullaitivu, a Government stronghold in the Northern Province at the front lines, has indicated that American operatives, posing as Red Cross aid workers, are arming the Muslim Home Guard, a pro-Government paramilitary group, providing them with rifles and rounds of ammunition.\n\nOur program to form more paramilitary and home defense groups in local municipalities has met with some opposition, particularly since it is hard to recruit willing civilians to defend their towns, as the attrition rate of civilians in this conflict has been particularly high.\n\nHowever, this move by the CIA has indicated that the United States intends to continue supplying both Government forces and affiliated paramilitaries, which hopefully will increase performance and capability to drive out the traitorous Tamil rebels in the north."

 # LATAM War on Drugs (Route A)
 ## Colombia
 CIA_LATAM.0.d:0 "LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe geopolitical region known as Latin America, commonly thought of as stretching from the United States’ border with Mexico, through Central and South America to the southern tip of Patagonia, has experienced intense internal and external crises and conflicts since the end of World War II, and particularly into the late 1970s and 1980s. (U/OU)\n\nUnlike other intelligence and analysis operations around the world, the Latin American region presents a unique challenge to US policymakers due to its location and current heavy American influence in the region. In particular, several issues dominate, including internal conflicts in Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua, and others. This Office has provided some recommendations for overall strategies in the region. (S)\n\n1. Maintaining the current United States policy of a strictly anti-Communist stance in the region. This may involve continuing contacts and operations in support of anti-Communist drug cartels and cocaine trafficking rings in the region, including MAS, as well as the Panamanian Government led by General Manuel Noreiga.\n\n2. Escalating the stated policy initiative known as the War on Drugs, chiefly by becoming involved in the internal conflict in Colombia, as well as increasing CIA operations on the southern border and within Mexico. This will involve more irregular operations, as well as operations in support of anti-Communist and anti-Cartel government forces in those selected regions.\n\n3. A less radical and violence approach, consisting of advocating for self-determination initiatives in the Latin American region. This would involve subtle silencing of Communist dissent, as well as ending any support for drug movements, and beginning operations against corporate influence in the region.\n\nThis Office strongly endorses all three of the above outlined strategies and is eager to begin its crucial work of securing American interests in the crucial region to its south."
 CIA_LATAMa.0.d:0 "It was a rainy morning in the Oval Office as President [USA.GetLeader] sat in the Oval, surrounded by CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, and several aides and officials from each office and agency, who were busy setting up a poster on a stand facing the desk and couches.\n\n“Mr. President, our decision to escalate the current War on Drugs campaign in Latin America has come with some challenges and benefits. However, our analysis has pointed to two large areas of focus: Colombia and Mexico.”\n\n“Colombia is currently in the middle of internal conflict which has commenced since the mid 1960’s. The two largest sides, the Government of Colombia, as well as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), have devastated much of the country and have caused regional drug cartels, such as the Cali Cartel and the Medellin Cartel, to arise in rural areas and begin their large-scale production of cocaine, which they traffick north to the United States. Operations in this area, which could consist of either covert or overt interventions, can cut the cocaine crisis off at its source.”\n\nThe President nodded. “I see. Now tell me about Mexico.”\n\n“The situation in Mexico is somewhat similar, and the relatively close location allows greater flexibility in operations. Mexico has become a prime staging point for the movement of cocaine from its manufacturing points in Colombia, and particularly from that of the Guadalajara Cartel, who has turned from trafficking through Florida to cross-border trafficking via points in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California.”\n\nThe FBI Director spoke up. “I can speak for the Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Administration that we are highly looking forward to engaging drug trafficking operations on the border and assisting the CIA in any operation they plan to deal with this terrible issue.”\n\nThe President spoke up. “Excellent, gentlemen. I’m excited to see where this goes. You all know to keep me updated, and specifically if I have to approve any operations, I expect reports daily.” The men nodded, as the poster disappeared with them, leaving the President leafing through the briefing left on his desk."
 CIA_LATAMa.1.d:0 "THE COLOMBIAN CONFLICT: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nHaving gone on since 1964, the Colombian conflict has had its roots in a period of repression known as La Violencia, having occurred from 1948 to 1964, where left-wing and right-wing groups consistently clashed. Now, in the 1980s, the Colombian conflict has reached new heights, with multiple belligerents and the addition of drug cartels and other paramilitary groups becoming involved. (S)\n\nThe major players in the conflict include the anti-Communist Government of Colombia, including the police and military, which is supported by most friendly anti-Communist countries in Latin America as well as the United States. The major insurgent groups include the Communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia People’s Army (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), the urban-based 19th of April Movement (M-19), most of whom are left-wing groups supported and assisted by the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, and other Socialist countries. (S)\n\nThe conflict has been further complicated by the large Colombian cocaine production and distribution capability which, in the midst of this civil conflict, has been co-opted by strong and well-armed drug cartels; the most infamous being the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel, and MAS. These groups are typically anti-Communist, but remain ideologically neutral, instead focusing on profits and preventing government enforcement of the law. (S)\n\nIt is in this environment that the United States is challenged to respond. This Office hereby recommends both covert and overt proposals for operations, recognizing that the former may guarantee plausible deniability, but that the latter may increase efficiency of anti-drug operations overall."
 CIA_LATAMa.2.d:0 "OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA: PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nColombia Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nWhile it is clear that the United States should ally itself with the Government of Colombia in the ongoing conflict, expanding operations against both Communist guerrilla groups, as well as drug cartels, such as the Medellin Cartel, would ensure continuing US influence in Colombia and destroy any capability for cocaine production and trafficking into the United States.\n\n1. Offensive operations should primarily be conducted against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Formed in 1964 as a result of government attacks on Communist militias, FARC is the single largest Communist paramilitary group in Colombia, and has spread out over primarily rural areas in cells throughout the country. This Office recommends embedding in local FARC cells, committing attacks against FARC units in the form of bombings and targeted assassinations of officials, in order to stoke internal dissent and prevent the organization from achieving its goal of unifying to present a conventional threat to Colombian regular forces.\n\n2. Additional supporting operations should be directed towards the Alianza Americana Anticomunista (American Anticommunist Alliance, or AAA), which is a right-wing, anti-Communist paramilitary group associated with Colombian military intelligence. Operating in support of regular Colombian National Army forces, the AAA has been implicated in a 1978 bombing of the Colombian Communist Party’s headquarters, as well as their newspaper. CIA assistance would involve arms shipments of small arms, advisors, and possible intelligence sharing.\n\n3. Lastly, the destruction of coca fields should also be accomplished. This strategy, including burning fields, cutting plants, or spraying plots from airplane using chemicals. CIA forces, supplemented by Colombian Air Force units, should be able to accomplish these operations, which are designed to eliminate drug cartel operations in Colombia and prevent funding to be provided to FARC and other Communist militias.\n\nSpecific proposals on each operation should be delegated to Colombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Operations, and should be cleared with the Directorate for Analysis and the Director before being forwarded to Special Activities Division."
 CIA_LATAMa.3.d:0 "“Mr. President, the CIA Director has some news on Colombia.”\n“Send him in, and thank you.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] smiled, shaking hands with [GetCurrentCIADir] as they sat down at the Resolute desk, the Director pulling out a file from his briefcase and laying it on the table.\n\n“Mr. President, with your approval, the CIA would like to begin extended operations against the FARC in Colombia.”\n\n“Very well. Update me on who FARC is again.”\n\n“Mr. President, FARC is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. They are a Communist guerrilla group currently fighting the Government of Colombia, whom we back. We intend on expanding offensive operations against them by providing further funding and support to the Government of Colombia, as well as escalating covert actions such as embedding agents into FARC cells and conducting targeted assassinations of FARC leaders and prominent figures to cause dissent in the movement.”\n\n“Very well. What is the CIA's prediction of these operations being successful?”\n\n“Very high, Mr. President. We hope that in particular with the assassinations, FARC will become internally divided and may split into warring factions which the Colombian Government will be better equipped to handle. As well, the CIA plans on cooperating with the government on a nationwide anti-FARC campaign in order to show the damage and destruction they have caused to the people of Colombia.”\n\n“Good, Director. This is approved. Please keep me updated on all events.” The President signed a piece of paper, as the Director smiled, placing his file back into his briefcase and preparing to leave. “Thank you, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.4.d:0 "As Jimmy banked the Air Tractor AT-301 slightly, he yawned, rubbing his eyes as he checked the compass and the map laying in his lap to confirm his heading. He had just passed over the small city of Pasto, in the southwestern Narino Department of Colombia, and as his turboprop winged above the mountains at 10,000 feet, he felt lonely.\n\nIt was approximately two in the morning, Bogota time, and as Jimmy continued to fly, he re-checked his tank indicator gauge, making sure that the tank was full of glyphosate herbicide, as well as dropping altitude to approach his series of targets; three coca fields, spaced roughly a klick or two apart, in the Patia valley.\n\nSquinting to make out the first one, Jimmy smiled as he saw a flashing light, pointing out his forward air controller squad, code-named “AGUILA”, who was tasked with distracting the cartel men and signaling the sprayer plane. Jimmy heard some automatic weapons fire as he began his pass, unsure whether it was AGUILA or the Medellin men. He smiled and waved at nobody as he dropped to 200 feet, punching the “drop” button to let loose some 100 gallons of herbicide into a fine mist over the coca plants, before pulling back up to a safe altitude, to do it two more times.\n\nAs he completed his last run, pulling to 10,000 feet once again, Jimmy was reminded of his first days as a crop duster in the Midwest, flying routine spraying missions, when he was stopped by a CIA recruiter. “How would you like to do some work for us down south, son?”"
 CIA_LATAMa.5.d:0 "As President [USA.GetLeader] walked back into the Oval after a short break between meetings, he was nonetheless surprised to see further charts being set up on tripods near his desk, and aides fluttering about, handing out folders and packets.\n\n“Mr. President, we believe that the situation in the Colombian conflict has deteriorated to such a degree that US intervention is necessary to support our goals and the goals of the Colombian Government.” National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] spoke up first, breaking the silence in the room.\n\nCIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] spoke up next. “Sir, our embedded operatives have strongly urged more offensive operations. The Colombian Government is fumbling, and is struggling to contain both FARC and the other Communist militia groups, as well as multiple drug cartels that are competing for influence and ability to distribute cocaine. Our operations can help, but can only go so far.”\n\nSecretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef] nodded. “We have begun implementing and adjusting contingency operations for Colombia. State can tell you more, but the Pentagon has tasked US Southern Command to take primary control of military operations. Preliminary recommendations include the use of air strikes and intelligence sharing against FARC forces, in order to allow Colombian forces to engage Cartel groups.”\n\nThe President finally found a chance to speak up. “Give me the diplomatic angle before I clear any military action. This situation is complicated enough as it is.”\n\nSecretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] broke in. “Our diplomatic relations with the Colombians have been cordial and effective. Our Ambassador in Bogota reports that US military and political assistance to Colombia has been successful thus far, but that the military faces a large corruption problem. He recommends dealing with that by halting some aid in exchange for reforms.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Very well. Thank you all, folks. Keep me updated, and I want regularly updated reports and plans from the Pentagon and Joint Chiefs. Nothing military-oriented happens without my signoff.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.6.d:0 "Based on a rather threatening request by the American Ambassador, our top generals have instituted an anti-corruption initiative within the Military Forces of Colombia. Presumably as a part of pressure initiated by the Americans, who have been providing millions of dollars worth of aid and advising, the top military commanders have created an “Anti-Corruption Unit” which will go about investigating petty and major corruption, particularly among officers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nIt is hoped that this will go somewhere, as the commanders have pressure to maintain it and allow the unit some autonomy, as it will report both to the Colombian General Staff and the President, as well as issue some limited reports to the American Embassy in Bogota."
 CIA_LATAMa.7.d:0 "“Hello?”\n“Secretary, this is Embassy Bogota. The Ambassador would like a word.” The phone clicked as the line changed to the US Ambassador to Colombia.“Secretary, hope you’re doing well this morning.”\n“Yes, Ambassador, I am. What’s this about?”\n“The Colombians have asked that we get further involved in the conflict, besides our current policy of providing overt military assistance in the form of assets and advisors. I’m hesitant to call the Pentagon as our Defense Attache really wants them to deploy troops and I don’t want to escalate.”\n“Very well, Ambassador, thank you. What do we suggest that State does in the meantime, in order to possibly hold off the Pentagon and USSOUTHCOM?”\n\n“Secretary, I think we should designate FARC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization; you have authority to designate groups under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. We then make multiple statements; I make one, you make one, the Pentagon makes one. It looks like we have a united front, we don’t necessarily have to have POTUS’s permission, but we can read him in. It would be “symbolically” declaring war on FARC without pushing it through the Oval Office or the Hill.”\n\n“And the Colombians?” The Secretary frowned into the phone.\n“They won’t know the difference. All they’ll hear is “declare war” and take it literally, and then the Pentagon can start deploying small numbers of troops to Colombia from Panama or Florida.”\n“Okay. Thank you Ambassador, I appreciate your forwardness. I’ll consult with staff and we’ll move on this as soon as possible. Thanks again. Goodbye.”\n\nHe put down the phone, sighing but thinking about what he had just heard. A genius idea."
 CIA_LATAMa.8.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, simultaneous statements from Foggy Bottom and the Pentagon were released today, as the United States Secretary of State officially listed the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In tandem, the Pentagon announced further defensive aid for the Colombian government in its fight against FARC, as well as sending further assets, advisors, and units of the United States Southern Command to task in Colombia. Facing normal praise in the West and criticism in the East, Colombia has welcomed this announcement as tacit American involvement in the conflict."

Units and detachments of the 24th Composite Wing, based from Howard Air Force Base in Panama, are authorized to engage all installations and headquarters of the Medellin and Cali Cartels in southwestern Colombia. The 24th Composite Wing Commander is authorized to use all available aircraft, including but not limited to A-7 Corsairs, C-130 Hercules, O-2 Skymasters, and UH-1 Huey helicopters.\n\n2. Units of United States Navy Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2), based on USS Ranger (CV-61); including Fighter Squadrons 1 and 2, Attack Squadrons 25, 113, and 145 armed with A-6E Intruders and F-14 Tomcats, are authorized for similar strikes on Medellin and Cali cartel installations on the western coast of Colombia, in cooperation with Air Force flights.\n\n3. Support units of Joint Task Force Bravo, stationed in Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras, along with all other support units from USAF Southern Air Division and Carrier Air Wing Two, are authorized to provide airfield and aircraft maintenance, weapons handling, target verification, and other support services.\n\nAll USN and USAF Commanders will independently select and verify target lists based on CIA and DIA intelligence reports and embedded personnel.

 CIA_LATAMa.10.d:0 "Today, a Department of Defense spokesman at the Pentagon announced the official expansion of US air operations in Colombia against major drug cartels in the region. Designating United States Southern Command, based in Doral, Florida, as the primary command for these operations, the Pentagon stated the reason for these strikes was to “protect American interests and partners in Latin America, ensure the end of cocaine trafficking in the region, and to assist the Military Forces of Colombia in their ongoing counterinsurgency mission.”\n\nAccording to further briefings from US Southern Command spokesmen, units involved include the 24th Composite Wing of the United States Air Force based out of Panama, as well as squadrons based from the USS Ranger carrier group, which intends to operate off the coast of Colombia. Reactions to this have been mixed, but the messaging has primarily been of assistance to the Colombian government, and of counter-drug enforcement operations which serve to assist all parties, regardless of ideology."
 CIA_LATAMa.11.d:0 "FARC INTELLIGENCE REPORT FNSJBFB-NN\n[GetDateText]\n\nThe latest intelligence from our cells, spread out throughout the country, have indicated the following information, specifically about expanded American air operations against our targets and Cartel targets.\n\nCells have reported spotting several types of American aircraft, including A-6 Intruders, A-7 Corsairs, C-130 cargo aircraft, and many UH-1 Huey gunships and utility helicopters. The presence of A-6 fighter aircraft, which are carrier-capable, suggests that the Americans are running some operations from a carrier group off the Colombian coast. The other aircraft appear to either be based from somewhere in Panama, or local aircraft stationed at Colombian military bases.\n\nFARC and friendly militia installations and camps have generally not been targeted by American forces, although a few cells have been affected by collateral damage or have lost weapons caches and vehicles. The Americans appear to be attacking Cartel positions, focusing on the Medellin and Cali Cartels who operate in western and southern Colombia, as their focus appears to be counter-drug enforcement operations, as opposed to standard counterinsurgency operations, against a force such as ours.\n\nSome regional leaders have expressed concern that these ongoing American operations will allow the Colombian regular forces to concentrate on FARC units, as well as deny our organization crucial funds required to keep the fight going. However, our capability remains high and we will persevere despite these imperialists bombing our land."
 CIA_LATAMa.12.d:0 "The analysts sat around the table, sipping coffee and waiting as CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] came in, only a short step from his office on the 7th floor of the Original Headquarters Building, at Langley.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen.” The Director smiled and shut the door. “Let’s get right into it. Tell me everything you know about Pablo Escobar.”\n\n“Yes, Director. His full name is Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria. Born December 1949, raised in the city of Medellin, in northwestern Colombia. Heavily involved in criminal enterprises since he was a teenager, including stealing cars and kidnapping of businessmen. First arrested in 1976 by the Colombian Security Service for trafficking cocaine from Ecuador. Escobar began to assert his influence, turning to bribery and assassination of officials, hiring gunmen and trafficking ever-increasing amounts of cocaine out of Colombia, and north into the United States, initially through Miami and the Bahamas.”\n\n“The corresponding cocaine boom in the early part of this decade has only increased demand for cocaine from Colombia, and has increased competition between Escobar’s Medellin Cartel, and their rival, the Cali Cartel. However, Escobar and his men appear to be caught in the middle. They oppose both the Colombian Government who wants to restore security, while also opposing FARC and remaining against Communist interference. According to Ops, CIA has tried to contact Escobar to seek cooperation, but has thus far failed. The Agency must come to a decision on what to do with him, and fast.”\n\n“Thank you, gentlemen. I see. Are you proposing we take out Escobar and his lieutenants?”\n“Yes, sir. DEA, understandably, and FBI are all over this idea; but they don’t have the resources or pull to make it work themselves. They know the CIA has the influence and funding, and we’ve done assassinations successfully in the past.”\n“So what’s the plan?”\n\n“Ops has proposed tracking Escobar’s movements for the next few weeks to establish a pattern of analysis as to where he and his lieutenants go; alternating between his home city of Medellin, and various homes that he owns in Cartagena, Colombia, and one in Miami. It may be that he lets down his guard enough to take a weekend off and that’s when we strike. Operatives from CIA, DEA, MACV-SOG, et cetera, will organize a strike proposal option, likely at his property at Cartagena, where we take Escobar, preferably alive, but dead will work as well.”\n\n“Very well. We will not read the President on this unless absolutely necessary.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.13.d:0 "USE OF ANTI-COMMUNIST CARTELS IN COLOMBIA\nColombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe situation of drug trafficking cartels in Colombia has presented an unusual situation for all involved parties, including the United States, in protecting US interests. While most cartels maintain an anti-communist ideology in the frame of expanding profit margins for their cocaine trafficking operations, they also must contend with continual interference and attacks from the Colombian Government, as well as share some practical ideals with Communist militias and other groups.\n\nIt is the opinion of this Office that certain large non-Communist cartel groups, such as the Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar, should be co-opted and folded into a general, government led, anti-communist alliance. This Office believes that the Cartels already have the money, distribution networks, and weapons required to combat FARC and other Communist militias, and if we are able to make deals with major cartels (on issues such as cocaine distribution and/or immunity from prosecution) we may be able to receive further Cartel aid and reduce the number of belligerents in the conflict. Consolidation must be key."
 ## Mexico
 CIA_LATAMa.14.d:0 "SITUATION UPDATE: MEXICO DESK\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite other conflicts and tumult occurring in the majority of the Latin American world, the US neighbor to the south, Mexico, is facing a unique situation as well. While maintaining rather cordial relations with the United States, Mexico is single-handedly responsible for the transshipment of over 50% of US imports of marijuana and heroin, both Schedule I controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nThe Mexican Government, led by President [MEX.GetLeader] is facing similar drug control problems as do nations further south, such as Colombia. Use of herbicide spraying and involvement of the Mexican Armed Forces in drug enforcement operations has proven unsuccessful, as the country remains a central point for both production of marijuana and heroin, as well as a staging point for trafficking of cocaine from other states, including Colombia. However, it is worth noting that unlike other Latin American drug-producing states, the Mexican population consumes very little of the drugs that it produces and trafficks.\n\nUnited States policy until now has been to force diplomatic pressure on the Mexican government to adopt more stringent control measures, which it has done most of the time, with varying degrees of effectiveness. This Office, along with other Mexican-focused offices and desks of the intelligence community and State Department, has proposed two possible changes in strategy to assist Mexico in its ongoing drug problem, and to advance American interests in the region.\n\n1. The United States could begin a covert approach to Mexico, operating to engage cartels without the knowledge of the Mexican government. This may be preferable instead of attempting to diplomatically pressure the Mexicans, and potential operations might include training of anti-Cartel militias, covert assaults on Cartel bases and installations, and an increase of DEA operations and funding.\n\n2. American policymakers might also consider a possible intervention in Mexico in order to forcefully stabilize the situation. It is hoped that this would be an international intervention and may involve a United Nations process. It is imperative that the Mexican government be consulted in this, in order to maintain friendly relations with Mexico and ensure no ill will. If Mexico is willing to accept international observers and aid, they will be better equipped to handle the drug issue.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that one of the two strategies will properly align the United States toward a path of good drug enforcement and adequately stabilize the drug situation in Latin and Central America."
 CIA_LATAMa.15.d:0 "COVERT APPROACHES IN MEXICO\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs relations between the United States and Mexico have deteriorated, the US intelligence community and State Department has determined that a covert strategy in the ongoing drug war is the next step in American policy as concerns Mexico and drug enforcement operations. This Office recommends the following:\n\n1. Training anti-Cartel militia units, also known as autonomous self-units, in municipalities and cities, specifically where Cartel activity is known to be high. The purpose of this is to train local Mexican citizens to defend their communities and to provide local autonomy in anti-Cartel operations, devolving authority to local governments.\n\n2. Conducting special forces raids on Cartel bases and installations; using resources of CIA, DIA, Delta Force, and SEALs, strategically attacking, raiding, arresting, and killing Cartel leaders and lieutenants, as well as delivery drivers and convoys, in order to interdict and send a message to Cartels that the US means business.\n\n3. Expansion of DEA border funding, as well as Border Patrol resources. This funding, pulled from already-appropriated CIA funding, would provide DEA and Border Patrol resources to continue to interdict and arrest Cartel members and drug trafficking through the US border and ports of entry, as well as approving additional jurisdictional powers for those agencies to continue their operations.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that further covert operations and cooperation with relevant US and Mexican agencies and officials will effectively interdict drug manufacturing and trafficking in Mexico, thereby stopping the flow of drugs into the southern United States and protecting our security at home and abroad."
 CIA_LATAMa.17.d:0 "It was dusk in the desert, and as the sun slipped below the horizon, the hot temperatures quickly began to cool. Thank god for that, Mason thought as he sipped on a bottle of water, waiting for it to get darker. He was sitting in a Ford Econovan, with Mexican plates of course.\n\n“Hey Gene, how’s it looking back there?”\n\nGene, his partner operative, nodded. “Looking good, boss!” He checked the hastily equipped surveillance equipment again, before loading the last bullet into his SIG Sauer P220 pistol, sliding the other loaded one across the floor to Pickett.\n\nThe radio crackled to life again, indicating the near presence of the assault team. “Overwatch, this is Dog One. Dog One, approaching LZ. Situation report, come on!”\n\nGene picked back up. “Dog One, this is Overwatch. Target Alpha all clear. Cleared to storm. Storm, storm, storm.”\n\nJust as he had finished, three Hughes 500D helicopters shot over the van, about 50 feet above them, coming to a landing inside the courtyard of the Cartel compound. Five soldiers, clinging to each chopper, jumped off, taking tactical positions, as the choppers lifted back off, providing covering fire from the air.\n\nGene and Mason moved out of their position as well, as the van pulled forward from its hidden position and stopped, fishtailing outside the entrance. The two CIA agents, rushing towards the courtyard, fought their way to the DEA assault team, who were busy laying fire down, arresting surrendering Cartel members, and inspecting the bodies of the handful they had killed on the way down.\n\n“Looks like we struck at the perfect time.” Mason said, taking a second to reload his pistol before moving to clear another room."
 CIA_LATAMa.18.d:0 "It was a cloudy morning in Washington as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency walked into the DEA headquarters building, located at 1405 I Street, only blocks from the White House and National Mall. As he got upstairs, to the top floor, entering his office, there was a note on his desk from his secretary, something about a call to his office from an unknown number, asking to speak to him. Most calls were screened, but this was from a government phone.\n\nGetting to work on some reports, the phone rang about 20 minutes later. He picked it up, expecting any number of people on the other end; his wife, a subordinate, et cetera.\n\n“Hello?”\n“Is this the DEA Administrator?”\n“Yes, to whom am I speaking?”\n“This is Langley. Check your operating budget accounts. There should be some new funds in there, in the neighborhood of $20 million. You’re welcome.”\n“What?”\nClick.\n\nThe DEA Administrator just looked around, before setting the receiver down. What the hell, he thought. More money to do drug interdiction programs, I guess, he thought a second later."
 CIA_LATAMa.19.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a proposal on a solution to the Mexico issue.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] paused from whatever business he had been attending to before, surely something less important than whatever was going to emerge from CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir]’s mouth. The Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState] was standing behind him, so that had to mean something.\n\n“Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, sir, the CIA has run an analysis of the situation in Mexico, US policy, and they’ve come up with an alternative to what we’re doing now. We propose an international intervention, either led by the United States or the United Nations, into Mexico, in order to stabilize the internal situation as well as provide crucial counter-drug and interdiction operational capabilities.”\n\n“I see. Do we plan to read the Mexicans in on this, Secretary?”\n\nThe Secretary of State nodded. “Yes, sir. We plan to make an announcement as well as an inquiry through the US Ambassador in Mexico City, with their options being that we will provide them aid and training, or if they refuse, we will attempt to find an international consensus via the United Nations and Organization of American States.”\n\n“I see. Consider this signed off, gentlemen. I presume the other alternative was to continue covert operations in Mexico?”\n“Yes, sir. We had considered that, but seeing as our relations with the Mexicans appear to be good right now, the diplomatic option may be preferable.”\n“Very well. Thank you, gentlemen.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President.” The two men exited out of the Oval, and glancing at each other, stood in the corridor for a minute. “Secretary, I hope you know what you’re getting into. Might want to get international support now while you can.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.20.d:0 "The US Ambassador to Mexico has come to our Secretariat of Foreign Affairs and Secretariat of Defense with a proposal to combat our ongoing drug enforcement problem in the country.\n\nThe White House, apparently concerned with our ineffectiveness in combating Cartel drug production and trafficking operations in Mexico, has proposed an international intervention in Mexico in order to stabilize the situation and to allow for assistance to the government to improve the enforcement.\n\nThe Americans have offered international law enforcement aid in the form of funding as well as cross-border cooperation in interdiction, but some officials within the government are concerned that allowing the Americans to dictate drug policy in their own country is invasive and counterproductive to political goals. However, the US Ambassador made clear that all in all, the US will get involved, like it or not. A crucial decision must be made, whether to enlist their help or to stand firm against Yankee domination over our affairs."
 CIA_LATAMa.21.d:0 "After a short conference with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington, indicating that the Mexican Government is open to American aid with drug enforcement operations.\n\nApparently seen as a quite controversial topic in some corners of Mexican political life, the issue was seen as a net benefit, and already, American DEA and Mexican Federal Police have met to discuss border cooperation and possible operations. Intelligence sharing is also expected to take place, and the Pentagon has already floated deploying some military advisors and security personnel to assist with the Mexican Secretariat for Defense.\n\nLatin American analysts have expressed optimism for the future, hoping that further US-Mexican cooperation will stop major Cartels from continuing their influence in Mexican politics, and halt the rapidly increasing drug problem in the United States."
 CIA_LATAMa.22.d:0 "After a terse meeting with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington that the Mexicans are staunchly against an American intervention or assistance in their country, on the grounds that further American influence in their country will continue to erode the political and social situation as well as continue the ongoing drug problem.\n\nThe Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs has included a public statement, revealing the plan, harshly condemning the request as “a nicely framed tactic of American imperialism in Latin America,” and that “Mexico will not be co-opted for American interests further south. We can deal with the ongoing drug trafficking problem ourselves without US or international interference.”\n\nOfficials in the intelligence and defense communities have reportedly been furious, along with President [USA.GetLeader] being briefed about the ongoing developments. It is clear that if the Mexicans will not comply, we will make them comply by all means necessary; even if it means turning to the international community."
 CIA_LATAMa.23.d:0 "In Mexico City today, a spokesman for the Mexican Secretariat for Foreign Affairs confirmed the previously unsubstantiated reports that the United States was seeking an intervention in Mexico against the ongoing drug cartel crisis. Mexican officials unequivocally condemned any possible intervention as “American imperialism in Latin America, the likes of which have been seen before in Brazil, Guatemala, and Cuba.”\n\nAmerican officials are reportedly disappointed by this development, but have vowed to continue on with a possible intervention. Some pundits have posited that the United Nations, or the Organization for American States may be contacted, but time will tell."
 CIA_LATAMa.24.d:0 "It was a sunny day as President [USA.GetLeader] gathered with his staff and subordinates for a small but formal ceremony. Gathered were the Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState], CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, the DEA Administrator, and the Chief of the Border Patrol.\n\nThey were all assembled there, no press, yet, because the President was signing an important, yet somewhat archaic and traditional, document; a presidential proclamation. But this was no ordinary proclamation; one that would also be accompanied by a joint resolution of Congress confirming its contents; a presidential proclamation declaring the United Mexican States to be a narco state, a country operating around the business of producing and trafficking drugs.\n\n“By the authority invested in me as President of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim the following:\nBecoming more rapidly concerned over increased flows of marijuana and heroin into the United States via its border with Mexico;\nConcerned that Mexican law enforcement and military units are not effective nor capable of engaging in the Cartels on their own;\nRecognizing the integral role that corruption, particularly of Cartel influence, in the Mexican political system plays in the above effectiveness of law enforcement in drug interdiction operations;\nI, as President of the United States of America, declare and proclaim that the United Mexican States is now considered a narco state under the above facts, and issues all warnings to civilians via relevant sources, such as the Department of State, of the dangers of traveling to Mexico for their own safety.”\n\nThe President sighed as he signed his name to the proclamation, knowing full well that this would only be the beginning to what was surely going to be an interesting situation for his administration."
 CIA_LATAMa.25.d:0 "As Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] sat in his office, he checked his schedule, before hearing a buzz from his outside secretary.\n“Secretary, you have calls from Ambassadors and Latin America Desk on lines one through four.”\n\nPicking up the phone, he hit “LINE 1”.\n\n“Good morning Ambassador, how are you? What’s the situation in London?”\n“Secretary, the British seem ambivalent about supporting an international drug enforcement mission. They have little influence or reason to get involved in Mexico, but the Foreign Secretary didn’t indicate that they’d vote against it.”\n\n“Very good, thanks Ambassador. Have a good day.” The Secretary murmured a goodbye before hitting “LINE 2”.\n“Ambassador, how is it looking in Paris?”\n“Secretary, the French are interested in contributing to a drug monitoring mission. They said they won’t vote against it in the Security Council.”\n“Very good, thanks.” The Secretary tersely switched to “LINE 3”.\n\n“Secretary, I know what you’re going to ask. The Brazilians, Argentinians, and Chileans are all in support of your program. The Colombians might be, but as you know they’re bogged down at the moment. Most of Central America is also in support except for Nicaragua, of course.”\n\n“Thank you, Latin America Desk. Keep your analyses going. Have a good day.” The Secretary felt bad but he had to keep this short, switching to his last call, “LINE 4,” the Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n“Mr. Ambassador, how is your work going in New York?”\n\n“Secretary, it’s been mixed. The Mission and I have been working around the clock to contact the other Missions here and get them on board, particularly the Security Council members and the Eastern Bloc, but very little luck so far. Many members outside of Latin America either do not care or consider it further US imperialism. We are trying our best, Secretary, and are working on language for a draft resolution right now.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Keep up your good work and keep up the reports. If you need a call from me, patch it through my office. The President wants this to happen and god damn it, I’m going to try to make this work.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.26.d:0 "It was the regular meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and as the members entered the meeting room of the Council in New York, they began to suspect a trap. The American representative, having already arrived, was going over papers, aides standing nearby. They looked up as the Soviet, Chinese, British, French, and non-permanent representatives sat down, being gaveled into order by the chair. Typically, the American Ambassador stood up first, launching immediately into their speech.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen of the Security Council, today I called a meeting to discuss an issue which the United Nations has dealt with before. Our neighbor to the south, Mexico, has had a continual drug enforcement problem, with multiple large cartels producing and trafficking marijuana and heroin across the border into the United States. This is affecting our youth, causing hundreds of deaths and addiction on both sides of the border, and providing organized crime with millions of dollars for their own uses.”\n\n“The Mexican government has attempted to use their law enforcement and military sources to counter these cartels but has been ineffective in this goal. The United States has tried to request to help, but the Mexican government has resisted our advances at every turn. This is an issue which not only affects us, but the entire Latin American region, if not the entire world. The War on Drugs is an international issue, and one that we, as a global leader, want to solve, with the assistance of the UN.”\n\n“As the American representative to the United Nations Security Council, I hereby place the following resolution onto the table, to condemn the drug crisis in Mexico, authorize a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and authorize the United States to take action to restore the rule of law in Mexico and eliminate drug trafficking operations.”\n\nSitting back down, the entire room erupted in a low murmur. As the American delegation sat in their corner of the room, they knew that this would only be the beginning."
 CIA_LATAMa.27.d:0 "Surprise at the United Nations in New York came today as the United States Permanent Representative on the Security Council approached the body and submitted a draft resolution concerning the ongoing drug crisis in the region.\n\nSubmitted days after the Mexican Government denied an offer for intervention to prevent drug trafficking, as well as US President [USA.GetLeader] declaring Mexico as a narco-state in a presidential proclamation, the draft UNSC resolution firmly condemns the ongoing drug crisis and Mexico’s ineffectiveness in stopping it, authorizing a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and placing that Mission under the leadership of the United States to restore the rule of law in Mexico and combat drug trafficking.\n\nWidely seen as an international example of the United States’ ongoing policy of the “War on Drugs,” the Security Council is widely divided on this; with the Soviet delegation and others condemning such blatant messaging but also not indicating any vetoes. Much of the non-Communist Latin American states appear supportive, with the obvious absence of Mexico."
 CIA_LATAMa.28.d:0 "Good news has arrived from our Permanent Representative to the United Nations today, as they have confirmed that the Security Council has approved our draft resolution on the Mexico issue.\n\nUnder consultation from the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the UN resolution stipulates the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, managed under the command of the United States and other participating countries. The resolution also firmly condemned the Mexican government for their ineffectiveness thus far in preventing drug trafficking.\n\nOfficials in Foggy Bottom, the Pentagon, and New York are quickly coordinating to establish a group of participating countries, as well as pre-positioning military assets near the Mexican border to begin the operation once it is formed by the UN."
 CIA_LATAMa.29.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from United Nations Headquarters in New York City, as the United Nations Security Council, acting under the influence and sway of the United States, passed a resolution authorizing the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico.\n\nApparently displeased with our government’s effectiveness thus far in combating the drug crisis, the UN has granted American forces permission to lead the Mission, with international personnel and support from the region and around the world.\n\nMany within the government, including President [MEX.GetLeader] are very displeased, and are urging any and all resistance to UN and American forces. Time will tell what the Mission does, how it operates with this crisis, and how we will respond"
 CIA_LATAMa.30.d:0 "Further surprise from United Nations Headquarters in New York City came as the United Nations Security Council, led by the United States, approved a draft resolution authorizing a UN Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico. Apparently recognizing the need for international drug control and enforcement, all five Permanent Members of the Security Council agreed on the issue, with no vetoes, even from the Soviet Union.\n\nPlacing the United States as primarily in charge of the Mission, it is expected that operations in Mexico will begin shortly. International support, both within the Security Council and in the General Assembly, will be required to receive more volunteers and enforcement personnel. Mexico, while not having officially commented, has had major government officials express extreme disapproval, and it is expected that Mexican government interference in Mission operations will occur on almost all issues."
 CIA_LATAMa.31.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from UN Headquarters in New York today, with our Ambassador to the United Nations calling the White House and informing [USA.GetLeader] that the Security Council resolution regarding Mexico has failed, with a veto by the Soviet Union, effectively ending any meaningful proposals the US had.\n\nState and Defense Department officials are reportedly furious, with members of the UN delegation in New York attempting to gain some traction in the General Assembly for a draft resolution there. However, any chance of a UN monitoring mission in Mexico has failed, due to Eastern Bloc interference and influence."
 CIA_LATAMa.32.d:0 "Good news has arrived from the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations, that a proposed draft resolution in the Security Council forming a UN Monitoring Mission in our country has failed, due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nSenior government officials are reportedly pleased, while diplomatic sources in the United States report that many State Department and White House officials are furious, and may be turning to contingencies to achieve their goals. It is still not known what the United States will do to continue this issue, but we can at least be safe from an international intervention for now."
 CIA_LATAMa.33.d:0 "More news has come from UN Headquarters in New York today as the United Nations Security Council rejected a US-authored resolution to form an international monitoring and enforcement force in Mexico to control the ongoing drug crisis there. According to UN officials, the resolution failed due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nWhile Mexican officials are reported as being relieved by this development, American officials are furious, particularly after they had mounted a campaign of international support for drug enforcement operations. It is not immediately clear if the US will act alone to solve the issue, but only time will tell."

 # LATAM Anti-Communist Priority (Route B)
 CIA_LATAMb.0.d:0 "It was a rainy Monday morning in the Oval Office, and as the President settled in with his cup of coffee, he prepared for yet another exciting briefing from his core group of national security staff; CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], and Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], along with a flurry of aides.\n\n“Mr. President, I’m sure that you’d agree that right now, our best course of action is to maintain an anti-Communist priority in the Latin American region.  Focusing on the cartels will not get us anywhere in the region, as the United States and allies would be focused on fighting groups from both sides. While the cartels are dangerous, Communist guerillas in Central and Latin America are even more dangerous, and have the institutional capacity to overthrow US-supported governments. It is our opinion that this should be the number one priority in the region.” The National Security Advisor opened up.\n\n“Very well then. Director, what does CIA propose to do to support intelligence efforts as a part of this plan?”\n\nThe CIA Director looked through some notes then spoke. “Mr. President, the CIA has primarily concentrated its proposals and analysis on Panama. The leader there, General Manuel Noriega, has been trained at the School of the Americas, is a strong anti-communist, and previously served as head of intelligence for Panama before he became leader. We believe he and his government will be a crucial asset in the region. As well, our focus on drug trafficking has primarily looked at cocaine, and possibly trafficking it to fund further operations against the Communists.”\n\nThe Secretary of State broke in before the President could respond. “Mr. President, as well, State has looked into expanding relations with anti-Communist Central American states such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. State has determined that possible inducements could be arms sales, economic aid, trade relation normalization, et cetera, if they continue to support intervention against Communist guerillas.”\n\nThe President nodded, setting down his cup. “This sounds like a good, well-coordinated plan. My only concern is how public we should go. CIA operations should stay covert, while diplomatic actions remain public. We do not brief Congress on this unless they ask, understood?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.1.d:0 "“What is this general’s name again?”\n“General Manuel Noriega, Deputy Director.”\n\nThe two analysts, having spent days preparing reports on Latin America, were seething at the proposition of having to simplify every bit of information for the CIA Deputy Director for Operations, as they sat in a conference room somewhere in Langley.\n\n“Okay. Noriega. What about him? What does the Latin America Desk have on him?”\n\n“Born in 1934, joined the Panamanian National Guard in the 1960s, was educated at the School of the Americas in 1966, was posted to anti-union operations for the United Fruit Company. Noriega rose through the Panamanian military, supporting Torrijos’s claim to power, and became his head of intelligence. During that time, he exiled over a thousand Panamanians that he deemed dissidents and became involved with narcotics trafficking; American law enforcement picked up on this in the 1970s but let it lie. In 1971, relations between Panama and the United States, particularly on intelligence, had become close enough that CIA placed Noriega on the payroll, and since then CIA has paid him about $100,000 to almost $200,000 a year, depending on the administration and budgetary priorities. Noriega is now the leader of Panama, succeeding Omar Torrijos when he died in 1981.”\n\n“Excellent, thank you.” The DDO paused for a minute to think. “The DCI and President have communicated to me some possible concerns about keeping Noreiga on the CIA's payroll, especially with increased scrutiny from Congress and his past dealings with drug trafficking. Is it worth keeping him on payroll, gentlemen?”\n\nThe analysts looked at each other, then at their notes, then forward. “Yes, sir. We believe Noriega has a unique position as leader of Panama and has the ability to funnel weapons and intelligence support to Contra forces in Nicaragua, and his location with the Canal allows a large strategic advantage. His past with drug trafficking may be able to be rectified via inducements by us or State, and some troops are still stationed near the Canal Zone. Enforcement is definitely possible.”\n\nThe DDO nodded. “I see. Very well, we’ll keep him on the payroll for now. Thank you, gentlemen.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.2.d:0 "Responding to some concerns in the White House and Capitol Hill about the usefulness of maintaining relations with Noreiga’s regime, the United States today, via the Embassy in Panama City and covertly, communicated further support for General Manuel Noriega and his government.\n\nWhile not specific about what the support would entail, it is expected that the US will provide economic aid, trade relations, military aid, in exchange for Noriega’s government continuing to support anti-Communist operations. The CIA Chief of Station in Panama City has privately expressed support for further American operations in the country and in Central America at large."
 CIA_LATAMb.3.d:0 "ANTI-COMMUNISM IN CENTRAL AMERICA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the fight to drive Communist influence out of Central and Latin America, the United States has depended heavily on anti-Communist regimes and friendly states to maintain the rule of law and order against radical guerrilla movements. Backing anti-communist leaders and parties in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama will be a responsible strategy to maintain influence in the following ways:\n\n1. Providing diplomatic support will ensure that those countries have adequate legitimacy and backing by a superpower, as well as the ability to receive economic aid and further international support in organizations such as the UN. This will increase trade ties and will ensure the continuing success of those countries.\n\n2. From the Pentagon, defense support will ensure that those countries receive equipment under the Military Assistance Program (MAP) in accordance with other anti-Communist states. Our analysis has concluded that their military capabilities are still years behind many European militaries, but equipment for counterinsurgency operations will be helpful for them.\n\n3. Finally, covert support in the form of intelligence sharing, embedding CIA operatives, training, and basing agreements will allow our operatives and intelligence operatives from those countries to properly coordinate resources and operations together to determine locations of Communist cells and methods of attack.\n\nIt is this Office’s sincere hope that these three prongs will serve as the main defense strategy for maintaining US influence, and preventing Soviet and Cuban influence, in the Latin American region."
 CIA_LATAMb.4.d:0 "Apparently as part of a renewed push by the American government to maintain influence in the region and drive out Communist incursions and rebel groups, the United States has announced an expanded backing program of anti-Communist Central American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama.\n\nThis support, reiterated by US Embassies in each country and by Foggy Bottom, consists mainly of defense support in the form of Military Assistance Program (MAP) arms sales and troop training. Additionally, diplomatic relations are expected to be beefed up along with economic and development aid being sent to each of the countries.\n\nReactions to this announcement have been mixed, with most government officials pleased that their American overlords will continue to support them regardless of their actions"
 CIA_LATAMb.5.d:0 "POSSIBLE USES FOR DRUG CARTELS: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; Drug Affairs Desk, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe presence and influence of drug cartels, organized crime syndicates focused on the trafficking of drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and cocaine, in Latin and Central America has proved a challenge in the multipolar geopolitical situation in the region. Cartel organizations, such as the Medellin Cartel in Colombia, the Guadalajara and Gulf Cartels in Mexico, and other, smaller organizations throughout the region have immense power and influence, as well as funding, weapons.\n\nOur analysis has determined that these cartels appear to be anti-communist in nature, although they are politically and ideologically malleable; the first priority of these organizations is to produce and traffic drugs, regardless of the political affiliation of their buyers. Some analysts have hypothesized that many cartel members, in the lower echelons, may be former disgruntled guerrillas that desire a change in their life and additional money.\n\nThis Office believes that the cartels mentioned above are in a financial and ideological position to be used for political benefit to the United States and its interests in Latin America. This could take the form of the following:\n\n1. American assets could assist in smuggling and other trafficking operations of narcotics around the region, with the particular focus on assisting large cartels in Mexico and Colombia. This would net the Cartels more earnings, ensure that their deliveries are not interdicted, and provide legitimacy that they are being supported by a major power.\n\n2. American assets could also assist the organization known as Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS), a Colombian paramilitary that is known to be funded by the Cartels already and has conducted many counterinsurgency operations against the Communist FARC and M-19 movements in Colombia.\n\n3. American intelligence personnel could also consider some limited domestic operations, including stonewalling or otherwise interfering with FBI and DEA investigations into drug trafficking, particularly if they are targeting Cartel members that the US supports."
 CIA_LATAMb.6.d:0 "Steve Wilkins leaned across his two-and-a-half-ton truck, smoking a cigarette as he watched the men, not 100 feet from him, unload a small Cessna 182 Skylane that had just been powered off and parked. He looked around, into the Nicaraguan jungle, more than a dozen klicks from anywhere, and then noticed the three or so armed rebels, nothing more distinguishing them than the FN FAL battle rifles they carried.\n\nAs he continued to smoke, he watched as the Contras unloading the plane moved bricks and bricks of cocaine, “snow,” into his truck, hiding it away in the far back, or in boxes of other cargo marked as “humanitarian aid.” He nodded to the men, who nodded back; confused about what they were doing, they’d see soon enough as the money began to roll in.\n\nAs they finished, he smiled, turning to the lead commander of the local Contra unit, slipping him a few cordobas before getting in the truck and starting his albeit short, but rather dangerous, journey to the coast.\n\nJust over an hour after he had left, Wilkins, code name “SKI LIFT” had reached his rendezvous point; a little fishing village, which he never learned the name of, on the Atlantic side of the country. There, he spied what appeared to be a small shrimp boat, rusted out, camouflaged in some near-water vegetation. Pulling close to it, he got out, taking a swig of water before lighting another one up, as he waited for the boat’s pilot to come to shore.\n\nHe didn’t know the pilot’s name, and probably wouldn’t have wanted to if the situation had presented itself. Shaking hands with the considerably tanner-skinned man, they began loading the bricks into the boat, three or four at a time. It took a few trips, this being a bigger shipment, but the two got it done, and promptly lit up again, shaking hands, before the pilot got in his boat, starting it and beginning to coast off, headed to Miami.\n\nSteve stood, watching, stamping out the butt of his cigarette. This had been a long deployment, but whatever Langley wanted, it got. At least it was a fairly routine mission."
 CIA_LATAMb.7.d:0 "Our efforts to smuggle larger and larger amounts of cocaine into the United States and throughout the region has been helped today by the assistance of American CIA operatives, who have been deployed to our strongholds in Nicaragua to assist with transporting the drugs across the borders, as well as with production of cocaine and protecting facilities from FSLN incursions and drug enforcement actions.\n\nIt appears the Americans are helping us primarily so that we can obtain funding for weapons and operations ourselves, instead of being dependent on them for covert funding. Their operations are going well, but it is unclear how long this is going to last, particularly because assistance to us, particularly with drugs, is seen as unpopular among congressional and administration officials."
 CIA_LATAMb.8.d:0 "Oscar Danilo Blandon sat in his van, in South Central Los Angeles, just waiting. It was a quiet summer day, and as he sat, he thought about how far his cargo had traveled from where it was made. Grown and refined in Colombia, smuggled via plane north to Nicaragua by Contra connections, hauled cross-country, onto a shrimp boat, shipped to Miami, and making its way via unmarked van to unmarked van all the way to Los Angeles, where he picked it up.\n\nHe was waiting for his partner, Ricky Ross. A Black native of this particular LA neighborhood, Blandon had been told that Ross was the only drug dealer in the city who had contacted the Colombians. This was great. Blandon had to count again, but he figured there were a couple million dollars worth of cocaine in the back. A tidy little sum to help his comrades in Nicaragua, fighting the communist bastards.\n\nRoss walked up, and shook hands with Blandon as he got out of the van. They were sitting outside a park, which was empty at the moment; thank God for that, both of them thought. Blandon popped open the back of the van, and the two of them got in, closing the door. They had to make this quick, before a “black-and-white” LAPD patrol car came.\n\n“Holy shit, man!” Ross whispered, seeing the bricks and bricks of cocaine. Blandon nodded. “It’s two or three million dollars there, if I had to guess. The Cartel made a larger batch this time.”\n\nRoss smiled. “Nice, man, nice. Let’s go take this back to my place, and I’ll call my dealers up, and we can get going. I’m really excited about this, and I think all my buyers will think this is great. By the way, where is the money going? Back to the Cartel?”\n\nBlandon looked down at the bricks then back up. “If I tell you, does it affect our deal?”\nRoss looked around. “No? Drugs are drugs. I was just curious.”\n“The Contras. Freedom fighters in Nicaragua, fighting against the tyrannical communist regime. The money is going to them for arms and operations.”\n\nRoss nodded. “Good.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.9.d:0 "“What the fuck is this memo?” The secretary outside the DDO’s office winced as she heard her boss yell. While not a rare sight, she mustered up the courage and walked in.\n\n“Sir, that memo is from the DDI and Latin America Desk. Apparently, they find it prudent to consider drug distribution here, in order to finance the Contras.”\n\n“Get me the DDI on the phone now! Fuck!”\n\n“Yes, sir.” She had never seen him this mad, but punched the line through to the DDI’s office, which was nearby but not close to the DDO on the Seventh Floor at Langley.\n\n“Deputy Director for Intelligence’s office. Who’s this?”\n“YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHO IT IS!! PUT YOUR BOSS ON THE LINE!”\n“Yes, sir.” There was a click, then the DDI picked up. “Yes?”\n“What the FUCK is this memo that I’m reading?”\n“Well, it’s what it looks like. Our analysts have looked it over and have come to the conclusion that helping the Contras to distribute their cocaine in the US and in other states will net them enough funding and influence to become more self-sufficient then they are right now.”\n“Are you fucking nuts? You know if this ever gets out, DEA is going to be up my ass, FBI is going to fuck me and the Hill? They’d crucify us! Do you hear me?!”\n\n“Congress might think twice when the Contras take their country back from the Sandinistas.”\n\n“Enough. Ops is not greenlighting this. End it. We’re done here.”\nClick.\n\nThe secretary turned slowly, trying to gauge the DDO’s mood. He still seemed angry, but the room was strangely quiet."
 CIA_LATAMb.10.d:0 "As the Latin America Desk staff gathered together for their weekly meeting, they settled in with coffee and pastries, being careful not to stain the files they had on the conference table.\n\n“Well, I’ve been looking into a new group that’s been making the rounds in Colombia,” said Jim, the analyst focused on the Colombian conflict. “They call themselves Muerte a Secuestradores, or “Death to Kidnappers.” The Desk Director nodded, letting him continue.\n\n“MAS appears to be formed and founded by the major drug cartels in Colombia, including the large Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar. Their main mission is not offensive, but defensive in nature, protecting Cartel and prominent landowners’ property as well as preventing kidnapping attempts by other paramilitaries. Other major funders appear to be the Colombian military and oddly enough, Texaco, based here in the United States.”\n\nThe Desk Director nodded. “I see. So this MAS. Where do they fit into our policy?”\n\n“Well, sir, MAS presents the perfect opportunity to become involved in Colombia without committing too many resources. They are committed anti-Communists, having conducted operations against FARC and M-19, the major Communist guerrilla groups in Colombia; they are connected with the drug cartels, in particular the Medellin Cartel, allowing US assets to contact the Cartel directly and initiate further operations.”\n\n“Interesting, Jim. Give me your report and I’ll pass it up the chain, we’ll consider backing MAS. Should be easy enough.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.11.d:0 "Sources from within the Colombian military and intelligence services are reporting that the United States has begun covertly supporting the Cartel-founded paramilitary group known as Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS), or “Death to Kidnappers.” Founded by the Medellin Cartel and assisted by some units of the Colombian Army, MAS was formed to protect Cartel and landowner property as a defense group as well as prevent kidnappings of Cartel members.\n\nThe Americans did not inform us of this development, perhaps out of a suspicion that we intend on prosecuting the Cartels. The US Ambassador in Bogota has made no comment, however, we have requested the CIA Chief of Station to report to brief our intelligence officials. It is not clear whether this will actually happen."
 CIA_LATAMb.12.d:0 "As Bob sat in the back of a nondescript Chevrolet Caprice, bumping along across rural roads, a jeep in front, he thought about what he was embarking on. After what seemed like weeks of searching and inquiries via agents and informants, the CIA Chief of Station in Bogota had tasked him with meeting The leader of the Medellin Cartel, none other than the infamous Pablo Escobar, at one of his villas in rural Colombia.\n\nHe was nervous but knew that nothing major would probably happen. He and Escobar already knew what was going to happen, and surely the Cartel wouldn’t do anything to him, unless they wanted to invite large amounts of American firepower and the dismantlement of their organization.\n\nPulling up to Escobar’s villa, he got out of the car and was promptly searched (again) by two of Escobar’s lieutenants, while a few others watched from various distances, carrying automatic rifles. Bob was unarmed, of course, but they had to check again and again.\n\n“Good evening, Senor Escobar,” Bob said, after he had been searched and escorted into the villa, where Pablo was sitting with a few lieutenants and other Cartel figures.\n\n“Welcome to the real Colombia-” Escobar extended his hand and paused.\n\n“It’s Bob, Senor Escobar. Very nice to finally be able to meet you. I’m sure you know what this is about.” They shook hands.\n\n“Yes, Bob. I’ve been told from some of my lieutenants that your CIA wants to expand collaboration with us and help with trafficking. I am interested but reluctant; how can you help us?\n\n“Well, Senor Escobar, we propose helping out with Cartel trafficking operations, primarily through directing it through Miami and across the Mexican border into the United States. There are plenty of American cities that are just discovering this cocaine of yours and it is a big market, particularly in Los Angeles. The funds you earn will both go back here to support your Cartel and the ongoing conflict in Colombia, as well as some funds to go to the Contras in Nicaragua, who are doing the same thing.”\n\n“I see.” Escobar paused, taking a moment to think before pouring out two glasses of aguardiente, a local liquor. “I will have to discuss it more with my traffickers, but I like this idea. I think we have similar ideas and goals, and, if your CIA is able to get the Colombian government off my tail, we’re in business.”\n\n“Yes, I believe we can do that.” Bob, seeing that Escobar was doing the same, took a glass, clinking it to Pablo’s as they toasted, marking the deal as done. “To more money for the cause!”"

 CIA_LATAMb.14.d:0 "MANUEL NORIEGA AND US RELATIONS: AN UPDATE\nPanama Desk, Office of Latin America Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the intervening period since the US has continued its support for Panamanian leader General Manuel Noriega, circumstances have changed in which the United States intelligence community may reconsider Noreiga’s usefulness to maintaining American influence in Central and Latin America.\n\nWhile General Noriega has contributed greatly to American security policy in Latin America, his behavior is undeniably a liability for US influence in the region. In particular, Noriega’s possible connections with organized crime, Cartels, and drug trafficking of cocaine presents a significant concern and development for future US-Panama relations.\n\nAccording to operatives and law enforcement personnel following Noriega’s activities, he has been involved with cocaine trafficking since the beginning of the decade, using covert transportation networks also used by the CIA to send funds and weapons to anti-Communist movements in the region. Primarily, Noreiga’s network has run out of Miami, where it is then spread to the rest of the United States. FBI and DEA personnel confirm this but are unable to take any punitive action against Noriega and his government.\n\nAdditionally, CIA confirms that opposition figures in Panama such as Hugo Spadafora and Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera also have knowledge of Noriega’s drug trafficking operations and have attempted to uncover them in the Panamanian popular media. Noriega’s government has not taken kindly to this, and Spadafora has not been heard from in several days, indicating that he possibly may have been killed or arrested. Neither men have been considered threats to the state before and are not left-wing in political ideology; in fact, both served under Torrijos’ government.\n\nThis Office hereby recommends a serious evaluation of Noriega’s usefulness to US interests in Latin America; if the allegations of drug trafficking are true, which seems to be substantiated, it is highly encouraged that the United States cut ties with Noriega, and consider taking punitive action towards Panama, including freezing all aid packages, arms shipments, covert transfers, assistance, and enforcing drug interdiction operations until the regime can be stabilized."
 CIA_LATAMb.15.d:0 "It was a sunny Monday morning in the Oval, as CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] came into the room for their daily briefing. Today would be just an ordinary briefing, but with one new item on the agenda: General Manuel Noriega of Panama.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen. I trust we’re doing well at Langley?” President [USA.GetLeader] looked up, smiling.\n\n“Yes, sir, all’s going well there. Here’s your Daily Brief for today.” The National Security Advisor laid the PDB down on the desk.\n\n“Great. What’s first on the agenda?”\n\n“Panama, sir. CIA’s been reconsidering the effectiveness and usefulness of keeping General Manuel Noriega within our sphere of influence and assisting his regime. There are allegations that he’s been conducting drug trafficking operations in Panama and moving cocaine between Colombia and Miami. He has also persecuted former allies who have attempted to uncover the drug trafficking operations, and Langley is concerned about the possible effect this could have.”\n\n“I see, what do you mean?” The President nodded, thinking.\n“Congress might catch wind, and that’s never good. We may lose international support in other places if we don’t respond to this promptly.”\n\n“Who cares about Congress? I say we keep Noriega in line with us.” The President had spent the last few minutes actually reading the brief in front of him, which happened to highlight Noriega’s help in security issues in Latin America.\n\n“Consider this, gentlemen. We have backed Noriega for years, he has been very friendly with us; we have provided him and his military with millions of dollars worth of weapons in their fight against Communist forces to their north; and Director, how long has this trafficking been going on?”\n\n“For years, sir. At least since he took office officially.”\n\n“So why now is all this coming to light? I see no reason why we need to cut the cord now. Doing that would only make our situation in Latin America worse. He’s an asset.”\n\n“Yes, sir.” Both men responded. The Director looked up. “Sir, we can issue a confidential statement to the Panamanians via their military or CIA, to reassure them of our continuing support.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Yes, it sounds good.” He looked around. “What’s next on the agenda?”"
 CIA_LATAMb.16.d:0 "According to unofficial reports from diplomatic officials in Washington, as well as sources within the US Embassy in Panama City, the US will continue to support the government of Manuel Noriega, despite a rather vocal opposition that questioned his usefulness in American foreign policy as regards his past with illicit drug trafficking, as well as other allegations.\n\nSenior American intelligence officials had been grappling with the issue of whether to maintain support for Noriega for weeks, particularly as the conflicts in Colombia and Nicaragua continue to rage on. Our government has yet to respond, although the only public response should be one of optimism and continued support. However, in the shadows, it is imperative that we contact the Americans and demand a reason for their reluctance."

We need to be fast about this, pretend like we were never there.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. President.” The CIA Director and National Security Advisor nodded, and went to make some calls. It would be a long day and an even longer night."
 CIA_LATAMb.18.d:0 "Shock radiated throughout Panama City today as confidential sources at the US Embassy reported that the United States was pulling back support for Manuel Noriega’s government.

Senior defense and diplomatic officials in Panama City who have been briefed already are indicating plans to accelerate the phased-out withdrawal of US troops from the Canal Zone, and other punitive actions, such as possibly declaring embassy officials as “persona non grata” and forcing them to leave.

 CIA_LATAMb.19.d:0 "It was dusk as a small, inconspicuous convoy of vans, heavy-duty trucks, and sedans approached the border checkpoint on the Paso del Norte International Bridge, connecting El Paso, Texas, with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. There was little traffic, and as the lead car, a gray, unmarked Ford Granada, stopped for inspection, they noticed there was slightly more police presence than normal; not on the American side, but on the Mexican side. In addition to the usual customs and border officers, were located Federales, on watch.\n\nThe convoy moved smoothly through, no issues, even with the trucks marked “Arizona Helicopters Inc.” and “Pacific Corporation.” The border guards didn’t bother inspecting the cargo, and they wouldn’t have liked what they saw. Hundreds of automatic rifles, thousands of rounds of ammunition, M72 anti-tank rocket launchers, a few Stingers; they’d have to train the men on those, but no problem. The larger trucks contained a few utility helicopters, completely disassembled, with their gun mounts ready for action. One of the operatives had said there was a Cessna somewhere, hidden away, apparently.\n\nAfter a few hours’ drive south from Ciudad Juarez, the convoy approached its destination; one of the central bases of the Guadalajara Cartel in Chihuahua State. They would conduct the training here, then the Cartel would distribute the equipment throughout their territory.\n\nThe operative got out of the lead car, lighting up a cigarette as he watched the trucks pass by, leading into the main parking area of the compound. This would be a long deployment period, and all his operatives knew it. The Cartel would be trained, because they were important to the US government, but whether they would be cooperative was another story. They are criminals in the eyes of normal people, after all. But no one here was a normal person."
 CIA_LATAMb.20.d:0 "Reports from the Federal Security Directorate and the Secretariat for the Interior seem to indicate that major Cartel leaders in Mexico, including the leaders of the Guadalajara and Gulf Cartels, appear to have received new arms and protection equipment of US make and model. DFS agents have conducted surveillance on Cartel properties with the assistance of Mexican Army and Federal Police units, and have determined that new US-made equipment, apparently received from a US company called “Arizona Helicopters Inc.” has been delivered to Cartel units; including small arms, heavy machine guns, armored pickup trucks, and a few old-model UH-1 Huey helicopters and Cessna airplanes.\n\nPresident [MEX.GetLeader] is reportedly furious at this development, particularly with the mixed relations that Mexico and the United States have. Some senior members within the government are expressing surprise at why the Cartels would be protected, particularly from enforcement operations by Mexico, an ally of the United States, ostensibly. It is unclear why this is, and the US Embassy in Mexico City has been unable to answer any questions on the matter. Time will tell."
 CIA_LATAMb.21.d:0 "As the joint FBI-DEA task force sat down for their meeting, a sunny morning in El Paso, Texas, they looked deadly serious. This had not been the first meeting; just a regular situation update for the two agencies.\n\nThe DEA agents began with their presentation first. “Our investigation into local Cartel activity has yielded significant results. The cross-border connection between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez is rather significant; although the transfers of drugs from Mexico into Texas are small-scale in nature; usually small amounts, a few pounds or two, via personal vehicles. DEA and ELPD have not seen large amounts of drugs over 5 pounds. Cartel activity in El Paso has been somewhat limited; we know there are members who are American nationals on the US side of the border operating as regional bosses and middlemen; however, we haven’t been able to connect them yet.”\n\nThe FBI agents nodded. “Alright. We know that there are large quantities of cocaine coming from the border cities; El Paso included, as well as Albuquerque, San Diego, and Laredo. FBI has identified a pair of dealers in Los Angeles who are receiving large shipments of cocaine from Colombian Cartels, but we’re not quite sure where. We may consider filing some federal warrants for bugging and other surveillance operations.”\n\nBefore he could continue, a secretary came in. “Special Agent, there’s a call for you.”\n\nHe stepped out of the conference room, moving to his office to take the call.\n“Hello?”\n“Is this Special Agent Jack Smith?”\n“Yes, who’s this?”\n\n“That’s not important. All you need to know is that we at Langley know about your investigation into Colombian Cartels. We know the judges you need to talk to. We know who you’re looking into, and it needs to stop now. Keep going, and you’ll learn the hard way not to mess with the Cartels.”\nClick."
 CIA_LATAMb.22.d:0 "In rainy New York City, Vincent Gigante looked out onto the Manhattan skyline. There was another man sitting in his office; Italian descent, sure, but not “from here.” He looked, acted like one of those rotten feds. Head of the Genovese Family, one of the five great Mafia families of New York, he had been visited by this man with a proposition: the great tragedy in Nicaragua, and a way his family could profit. Surely there were a lot of Nicaraguan emigres in New York City, right?\n\nA thousand miles south, in sunny Miami, Florida, Jose Miguel Battle Sr. had been approached by three similar men. Colleagues of his, all former soldiers in Brigade 2506, having survived the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion, all here for the same reason. The Corporation, as it was known in Miami, the Cuban Mafia, as it was also known, could have great solidarity with this fellow anti-communist group in Nicaragua known as the Contras. Or that’s at least what they claimed.\n\nAlso in a famously sunny place, Southern California, members of the Mexican Mafia were being contacted. Some were in prison, some weren’t, but it didn’t matter. The men in black from Langley had their ways. California was an excellent transshipment point for cocaine, as was Miami, and the Mexican Mafia had a lot of influence both there and across the border in Tijuana.\n\n The men from Langley all had one goal. Criminal organizations had plenty of influence in the United States, particularly in urban areas where drug trafficking and crime was high. Surely they had to have the money, weapons, and resources to send to their brothers in arms in Nicaragua, right?"
 CIA_LATAMb.23.d:0 "More news has come from the CIA operatives assisting us; Langley has apparently directed operatives to work on rallying support for the Contra cause among organized crime groups in the United States. While not specific, the CIA has informed us that the criminal Cuban exile community in Miami, centered around Jose Miguel Battle Sr, a Bay of Pigs veteran himself has pledged support to us; as well as the Mexican Mafia, which is located around the US-Mexican border as well as Southern California. Additionally, two of the five prominent New York City Mafia families have also pledged their support for our cause, and are willing to shift funds, some mafia members, and weapons to the Contras to support our mission.\n\nMany within our organization are glad to hear this development, particularly the support from the Cuban Mafia. Others seem reluctant about the development, becoming worried of the lack of legitimacy among these criminal groups as opposed to a sovereign state like the US."

 CIA_LATAMc.0.d:0 "It was an overcast and foggy morning in the Oval Office as President [USA.GetLeader] sat, watching as his Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] and their flurry of aides enter the room, with files and papers seemingly flying everywhere. The President waited for the chaos to simmer down before opening up the room. “Gentlemen, why are we here today?”\n\nThe Secretary of State began. “Well, Mr. President, State has had several meetings with CIA and defense officials about the future of US policy in Central and South America. In the past, the United States has taken the wrong step in that region, and we seek to change that.”\n\n“Go on, Mr. Secretary. I assume this means a more peaceful strategy as I have mentioned in my foreign policy positions.”\n\n“Yes, sir. We think that the US has needlessly enabled authoritarian right-wing regimes in Central and South America as part of a misguided attempt to combat the spread of communism in the region. While that has been marginally effective, it has had the unfortunate side effect of creating militarized states controlled by officers who have personal ambitions, creating even more instability.”\n\nThe CIA Director broke in. “Not to mention, Mr. President, this region is faced with a major drug trafficking challenge, something that our Agency has not seen on such a scale before. Large shipments of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are moving north from Colombia, being shipped by cartels, and usually supported by right-wing governments. I know your administration has campaigned on ending the War on Drugs campaign, but this is an international issue that we need to take part in.”\n\n“Ensuring self-determination and the effective rule of law exists in Central America is critical, Mr. President. Democratic societies ensure greater accountability to all parties involved. In particular, we’d like to expand peace initiatives in Nicaragua, as well as determining cutting aid programs in Central America and reexamining our cooperation with General Noriega in Panama.\n\n“Excellent, gentlemen. I trust you all to do this with the highest degree of professionalism and report to me with all changes. I expect to read at least once a week at least on this issue.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President.” The men and their aides nodded in approval, as they exited the room, just as the sun began to show itself form behind the clouds, brightening the room."
 CIA_LATAMc.1.d:0 "It was a hot night in Oaxaca state as the jeep rumbled down the dusty street in Tehauntepec. The driver knew exactly where he was going, but the passenger, Ruben Ocampo, wasn’t so sure. All he knew was he had to meet some local officials, as his brief said, at their home tonight.\n\nOcampo looked around, noticing the barrio that he was passing through. It was nothing fancy, on the outskirts of town, unfortunately what you’d come to expect in this area, with these people. It was a shame what had been done to them, but that’s what he was there for.\n\nGetting out of the car, the “investigative reporter” walked down the driveway, watching the jeep roll away. He held a notebook in his hand, acting normal as ever. Knocking on the door once, he was ushered into the home, sitting down in the dining area, where three men and one woman sat, in traditional Tehuana dress. These people were indigenous Zapotec people, most of whom lived in the region, but they were important political organizers, albeit nearly underground due to PRI influence.\n\nWhat was said wasn’t necessary, but Ocampo asked them about their activism and organizing and how the local governmental authorities had ignored them. He asked them about how they felt about the cartels in their area; how they felt about the growing Zapatista movement in their area, and where they and their organization stood. Ocampo smiled, nodded, and cracked jokes; for all they knew, he was an investigative journalist with La Prensa, a Mexico City paper. Their conversation was not long but not short, and productive.\n\nAs Ocampo was whisked back out of the house, back to his driver, back to Mexico City, he reviewed the notes. This would be a long report to type up, one that hopefully his Chief of Station in Mexico City would appreciate. The indigenous groups seemed to be anti-government, anti-cartel, and pro-communist. Interesting stuff, he thought."
 CIA_LATAMc.2.d:0 "POLITICAL REFORMS IN CENTRAL AMERICA\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe geopolitical region known as Central America (including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama) have been plagued by continual political crises since the beginning of the postwar period. Attempts at political reform have been proposed and some implemented, but most have failed due to US or Communist interference. Therefore, this Office proposes the following general political reforms in order to improve democratic rule and the standard of living in the region:\n\n1. Executive reform, in the form of perhaps limiting presidential powers, including the power to declare war, declare a state of emergency, and powers relating to the command of military units. This would most likely require constitutional revision in most Central American states, which will require persuasion of the national legislature.\n\n2. Judicial and legal reform, in the form of strengthening Supreme Courts and national judicial branches. This can be accomplished by enshrining judicial review of constitutional and legislative actions which are designed to provide a balance to executive and legislative actions in those countries.\n\n3. Finally, military reform, in the form of introducing further checks against military coups, such as providing civilian leadership of the military, barring military officers from running for office, and restricting aid to Central American militaries who are not compliant with US enforcement regulations.\n\nThis Office, together with relevant US Embassies and the Department of State, believes urging these reforms will ensure adequate governing style and self-determination for that region, without excessive presidential powers or harassment from Communist forces."
 CIA_LATAMc.3.d:0 "A joint American State Department and CIA campaign has come to our region, encouraging a broad program of political reforms in our countries. Apparently in an attempt to guide Central American states toward an American model of government with representative democracy and republicanism, the US Embassy has urged reform of the executive and judicial branches as well as the military; including limiting the power of the President to declare states of emergency, combat insurgencies, as well as providing possible judicial review mechanisms. Finally, the US has proposed military reforms, which have angered some in our government, that have been “designed to prevent further coups” which in reality will weaken the influence and capability of the armed forces in the future if we choose to accept them.\n\nIt is unclear how our government should respond to this. Reforms are necessary, some say, to further democratize the country; but others contend that reforms would provide more influence to radicals of both wings within the country. There is also understandable concern that the military reforms will result in decreased capability. Many contend that reforms, especially dictated by the US, are not necessary, but perhaps acceding to demands from Washington will turn out to be good in the long run. How should we move forward?"
 CIA_LATAMc.4.d:0 "News has come in from our embassies in Central America that the governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama have all agreed, in principle, to political reforms that have been suggested by CIA chiefs of station, operatives, and State Department officials.\n\nSome of the political reforms, proposed by a Joint Working Group of CIA and State political advisors, have included executive reforms in order to curtail presidential overreach, judicial reform in the form of introducing judicial review and American-style legal systems, and military reform in the form of introducing civilian control of the military, eliminating corruption, and threatening to end MAP aid to those countries.\n\nLangley and Foggy Bottom are both rather surprised that these countries agreed to such reforms so easily, but are making immediate bounds in determining enforcement regimes to ensure that all parties adhere to the reforms they promised to do."
 CIA_LATAMc.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, news has come in from our embassies in Central America that the governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama have all rejected proposed political reforms that have been suggested by CIA chiefs of station, operatives, and State Department officials.\n\nSome of the ill-fated political reforms, including proposals to limit presidential overreach, introduce judicial review and American legal systems, and provide for civilian control of the military were all soundly rejected by each and every government, with the accusation of “further attempts at imperialism from Washington into our internal affairs.”\n\nLangley and Foggy Bottom are understandably furious over this development, particularly the reputation that will proceed once the international press catches wind of these developments. Damage control plans are in place, but neither agency, nor the President, will be happy about this development."
 CIA_LATAMc.6.d:0 "HANDLING COMMUNIST IDEOLOGUES IN CENTRAL AMERICA\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn our newfound plan to advance ideals of democracy and self-determination in Latin America, the problem of Communist parties and ideologues in all of those states presents a hindrance to our development. While the United States remains fundamentally opposed to communism, we cannot interfere in democratic processes, particularly those involving the left wing. Ideologues, however, present a fundamental threat to American influence and self-determination and must be sidelined.\n\n1. Coercion could be used to blackmail or otherwise extort Communist ideologues to either recant their ideology, change it to social democracy which will not be as politically radical as communism.\n\n2. Currency payments and other cost of living benefits may also be considered as a means of sidelining ideologues and Communist party officials in Latin America, although this strategy is not recommended primarily because this will increase dependence on further cash payments.\n\n3. Finally, appealing to ideologues’ and leaders’ egos may also be beneficial to sidelining them. Simply ignoring or directly fighting Communist leaders will not be effective, but properly sidelining them while making them feel successful will be effective in keeping them under control while we advance our plan.\n\nThis Office believes that properly sidelining the Communists covertly will maintain semblances of democratic values and self-determination without being overtly involved in the region, and not affecting other parties of the left wing."

However, it is time for us to end this relationship.\n\nYour activities surrounding trafficking of marijuana and cocaine have presented quite a concern to the current administration. Previous administrations and presidents may have tolerated this sort of behavior but it is in the best domestic and international interest of the United States not to collaborate with organized crime elements, particularly those in other sovereign states, and especially those that are responsible for funneling dangerous narcotics.\n\nThis letter serves as final notice from the United States Government that we will not continue cooperation with your criminal enterprise and will be eagerly supporting any and all law enforcement attempts to shut down your operations.\n\nRegards,\nPresident [USA.GetLeader]\nCIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir]"

The watch officer for Latin America reported last night that a joint Miami PD-DEA task force seized a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship with hundreds of pounds of crack cocaine hidden aboard it.”\n\n“Shit.” The DDO put his head in his hands.\n\n“Yes, sir. Noriega denied any responsibility but we know he did it, he’s not even being careful anymore.” The Ops officer shrugged.\n\nThe DDO straightened back up again. “Alright. It’s done. We’re ending this.” He pointed to the two men across the table. “Stay here. I’m getting the Director and the National Security Advisor on the phone. We’re cutting Noriega off. Enough.”\n\nWithin minutes, the Ops officer sat in shocked silence as Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] came on the line, in addition to National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv]. The two other men agreed, and a call was put into the President, via the DCI. The Ops officer and his deputy sat, waiting for an order. He was sure the Chief of Station would have to be called too, but this was happening real fast, he thought."

 CIA_LATAMc.11.d:0 "COMPROMISE WITH NICARAGUA?\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; US Embassy, Managua\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAfter years of backing anti-Communist “Contra” forces in Nicaragua, currently ruled by a Marxist Sandinista government known as the FSLN, the United States may now be faced with a new opportunity to turn the tide in the conflict. Instead of continually backing the Contras, forcing a frozen conflict that would end in a stalemate, this Office recommends a compromise with the Sandinista regime to ensure parity between both parties and end the conflict.\n\n1. An immediate ceasefire and end to hostilities while negotiations begin. This will be on both sides, with the United States seeking to enforce the Contras from committing violence or attacks against Sandinista forces.\n\n2. The formation of a temporary Coalition Government, composed of equal amounts of Sandinista (FSLN), Contra, and democratic parties. This will allow a stable governing structure, and the maintenance of ceasefires, while further democratic reforms are put into place.\n\n3. Once the Coalition Government has been formed, elections will be held at an agreed upon time. These elections should be observed and enforced by international observers, both from the United States, other Central American countries, and teams from the United Nations and Organization of American States; to ensure that either party does not rig the election or otherwise coerce the populace into an unfair election.\n\n4. Finally, a constitutional convention will be convened with the cooperation of both the Sandinistas and the Contras to determine a new, pluralist, multi-party and democratic constitution, designed to ensure and enshrine a more permanent and democratic government, as well as the cooperation (or friendly competition) of the Contras and Sandinistas. Further reforms should press demobilization, military reform, and other changes designed to eliminate further outbreaks of violence in the country."
 CIA_LATAMc.12.d:0 "The US Ambassador to Nicaragua has come to the Office of the President of Nicaragua [NIC.GetLeader] with a compromise in our effort to crush the American-backed Contra, anti-Communist rebels.\n\nThe Americans, presumably in an attempt to extricate themselves from their proxy war against us, have proposed a ceasefire, the formation of a Coalition Government between our FSLN and the Contra rebels; the scheduling of free and fair elections, and a constitutional rewrite to ensure plurality and multi-party democracy.\n\nFigures in our government have had mixed reactions to this development. Since the Ambassador has come and gone, various ministers have voiced their support for or displeasure with the deal. Some think it would be a good idea in order to stop the conflict and perhaps invite better US perception of the regime; but many others, ideologically committed, have remained against it, convinced that the deal is not beneficial to Nicaragua and that submitting to US hegemony is not the way to solve the issue; instead, crushing the Contras should continue.\n\nThis is a difficult and nuanced issue, but the President wants to reply to Washington soon. How should we respond?"
 CIA_LATAMc.13.d:0 "Surprising news has come in from our Embassy in Managua that the government of Nicaragua, under the Marxist FSLN, also known as the Sandinistas, have accepted our proposal for a compromise to settle the conflict between them and the US-backed anti-Communist Contra guerilla groups.\n\nOur proposal, consisting of a ceasefire, the formation of a Coalition Government, a new constitution and free, observed elections, was reluctantly accepted by the Sandinistas in Managua today, with a government spokesman stating that “concessions are necessary to ensure peace and stability in Nicaragua once again.”\n\nFoggy Bottom and Langley are moving forward to implement a two-pronged program to begin the peace plan, with the CIA reaching out to Contra figures to begin a ceasefire between the two parties, and the State Department working out of the Embassy to maintain contacts with the Sandinista government as well as to gain international support via the UN and OAS for enforcement of the peace plan."

Military aid to Central American regimes, including Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, designed to augment their security services, has been misused, according to the Office of Latin American Analysis, instead being used for internal counterinsurgency operations, including extrajudicial killings, beatings, and destruction of civilian property. Little accountability has been shown by chief military leaders in all states involved.\n\n2. Economic aid to Central American regimes, designed to augment their agricultural and manufacturing capabilities as well as to improve infrastructure and communications systems, has been massively misused by each of the governments; instead, being diverted to coffers of prominent government officials, used as bribes, or placed in the budget of the military and other security services. There is no enforcement of economic reforms, nor is there enforcement of construction initiatives on the part of the United States.\n\n3. Covert aid, in the form of operatives and operational assistance in combating communist movements and drug cartels, is being hampered by high officials in governmental positions. Operatives within the Directorate of Operations have reported that their operations and orders from above have been stonewalled by uncooperative security services personnel, sometimes requiring bribes and other forms of coercion to accomplish designated mission goals.\n\nIt is the opinion of both Offices, and therefore both the Directorate of Intelligence and Directorate of Operations, that all forms of aid to Central American regimes must be stopped unless the United States can negotiate an enforcement plan with the countries receiving aid, and they pledge to submit to further checks."
 CIA_LATAMc.17.d:0 "Stunning news has appeared from the US Ambassador today as the United States simultaneously announced that they will be halting all aid to our country and other countries within the region if we do not take more action to ensure that the aid is not being misused.\n\nCiting concerns about mismanagement and corruption within our government and within the region at large, the United States has said that they will end all military, economic, and covert aid and assistance to us unless we agree to negotiate further enforcement of aid spending and use under their watchful eye.\n\nMembers within our government are split on the issue; prominent political and military officials argue that we can simply seek another, more agreeable benefactor, while lower-level officers and bureaucrats argue that acceding to further enforcement will provide a better option in the long run under US influence.

In particular, emphasis was placed on ensuring that aid will be used for economic and infrastructure improvement, as opposed to the current use which is towards military officials, counterinsurgency operations, and bribes to prominent government officials.\n\nFoggy Bottom is pleased with this development and expects to brief the President and other diplomatic and security officials within the end of the day."

As previous administrations have proven, maintaining our reputation among Latin American countries is paramount. In the past, we have treated them as a vessel of exploitation, for economic benefit; by our government, or US corporations. However, the United States should not fall into the trap of installing right-wing governments in order to maintain a friendly face. Maintaining self-determination initiatives in the region should be the utmost priority as the United States has had a history of influencing elections in the past.\n\n2. Drug enforcement operations should also be highlighted as a primary concern of US-Central American cooperation, in addition to further military aid and training initiatives proposed by the Pentagon. In particular, the US wants to push a combined, international effort via the Organization of American States to end trafficking of cocaine and marijuana via military and law enforcement actions.\n\nThis Office believes that this double-pronged policy plan will stabilize the region without conceding to radical interests on either side of the political spectrum and will effectively maintain US influence with little to no belligerency."
 CIA_LATAMc.22.d:0 "As Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] entered the large conference room, a hush fell over the room, among the business executives and senior vice presidents sitting there. None of them knew why they had been called here, just that their secretaries had been spooked by mysterious phone calls directing their bosses to come to Langley right away.\n\n“Gentlemen, welcome to Langley. I’m sure you’re all wondering why we called you here.” Most of the executives nodded. “Some of you probably think we’re going to ask you to do some secret-spy missions, but that’s not why we’re here.” That elicited a small laugh, which the DCI was glad about, because he was about to turn to a more serious subject.\n\n“You’re here because your companies and corporations have heavy influence in Latin America. From Chiquita, to Cargill, to Freeport-McMoRan, industry is diversified and I’m sure that your shareholders and the local economies in the region appreciate it.”\n\n“However, we here at the Agency, as well as across the Potomac in DC, have become concerned about some of your actions. Many policy officials at State and Commerce believe your business practices are inherently destabilizing the region, and that your influence is helping to prop up right-wing and neo-fascist regimes in the region.” The room was suddenly filled with a quiet hush of confusion, leading to a louder volume of blustering.\n\n“Now, I admit that our government in the past has no better, but we have changed our ways and are committed to helping with reforms in the region. You all know as well as I do that your corporations hold just as much if not more influence in Central and South American governments; they are so economically dependent that if you make them reform, they will follow through.”\n\nThe executives looked down, around at each other, then back up at the DCI. “Are you for real?,” a senior vice president at Cargill asked.\n\n“Yes, yes, I am. You would still have economic benefits, but also providing the people with a better quality of life. You are paying them, you know.”\n\nThe executives sighed. “Okay. We’ll take it back up with our boards, I suppose, at least I will. Not sure how this’ll go, Director.”"
 CIA_LATAMc.23.d:0 "It was a hot night in southeastern Guatemala, near San Marcos, as an employee of Chiquita, formerly United Fruit Company, drove down the dusty road in his new but beat-up Ford sedan. He was not a native employee, but an American mid-level manager, sent to supervise the banana production in the area. His bosses hadn’t cared where he was from, just that he knew enough Spanish to yell at the laborers, and enough sense to know how to bribe the local council and soldiers.\n\nHe kept driving, swiping the sweat from his brow. Stopping at a checkpoint outside the city of San Marcos, he pulled out his papers and a few quetzals for the soldiers; he knew they needed the money, anyway.\n\n“Buenas noches, gentlemen,” the manager said, extending his papers as the window finished rolling down. The soldiers smiled, taking the money but flipping through, then tapping on the door for more. The manager shrugged. “That’s all I have, guys.” The soldiers nodded, opening the gate and letting him through.\n\nTen seconds later, the car exploded in a hail of automatic gunfire, dozens of bullets shattering the glass and leaving the manager a bloody mess. One of the soldiers, walking over to the car, busted the rest of the window, dispatching the man to make sure he was really dead.\n\nAnother man on a motorbike, coming the other direction, stopped, as if he knew what was going on. He got out, waving to the men, who lowered their guns. “Here’s your pay, men.” The two smiled, splitting the bills and stuffing them in their pockets as they checked their rifles again. Another banana man dead, they thought. Whatever it took for the highest bidder."
 CIA_LATAMc.24.d:0 "Marcus Greene was tired from the day’s heat, but they had just gotten a new lead. As part of a new program with the National Police of Nicaragua, Greene had been embedded as an advisor, albeit one with some limited roles. The Nicaraguan Government had been suspicious of the CIA’s eagerness to help, but when they mentioned preventing Contra drug trafficking, the Sandinistas reluctantly accepted.\n\nThe police embedded with him were no ordinary cops; they had been trained in drug enforcement to an extent but were coopted by the Communists during their rise to power. Politics really didn’t matter here, far from Managua, as they had a shared goal.\n\nGreene and his squad were at a port, albeit a small one, where the police knew cocaine traffickers came. They had seen a dozen small fishing and shrimp boats and had searched all of them but to no avail; however, one officer had talked to a local man who reported he saw a white man helping to offload something out of a truck and onto a boat. It was worth investigating, especially since the Contras were known to heavily operate here.\n\nGoing out to deeper water in a dinghy, Greene pointed out the boat that the man had identified. It was a rusty, 20-foot long, barely seaworthy boat, with a Panamanian flag; not overly suspicious, but typically what would be used to traffick drugs. There was one man on it, a nervous-looking guy; Greene guessed he was the owner of the boat. The Nicaraguans questioned him briefly, before he tried to wave them off to no avail. A brief scuffle erupted, but the man was tackled and shoved against a wall, where the Nicaraguan cops beat him before cuffing him.\n\nGreene looked out on the water, wondering how many other small boats they hadn’t been able to catch today. At least they got one. His sergeant came up to him, seeming to indicate that they had captured hundreds of bricks of cocaine down there. Guess the Contras would miss those, he thought."
