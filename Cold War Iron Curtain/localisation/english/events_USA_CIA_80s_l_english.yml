 # Sri Lankan Civil War
 CIA_SRL.0.d:0 "SRI LANKAN INSURGENCY: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn recent years, tensions between the Sri Lankan Government, dominated by the Sinhalese ethnic group, and the Tamil ethnic group, located in the north of the country, have escalated into violence. Tamils have alleged systemic discrimination against them in employment, education, and language, particularly concerning the 1970s policy of standardization which systematically limited Tamil students from gaining entrance into universities. (U/OU)\n\nThe Tamil opposition to government policy has existed in the form of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), acting as the legitimate political opposition since 1976; while militant groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been formed under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran. Both groups, while differing in their methods, desire for the creation of a secular, socialist state of “Tamil Eelam” located in the Tamil-majority north of the country. (S)\n\nRecent anti-Tamil riots and demonstrations, including one in 1977 that resulted in 125 deaths, and the burning of the Jaffna Public Library in 1981 by a Sinhalese mob, have continually increased tensions towards full civil war. Now, in 1983, the fire has begun to burn bright, particularly after a Sri Lankan Army patrol, known as “Four Four Bravo” was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. The period known as “Black July”, has resulted in multiple anti-Tamil pogroms, massacres of prisoners, and hundreds of deaths. (S)\n\nIt is estimated that the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups will continue to harass and outright fight Sri Lankan Army units. However, the situation is unclear outside of Sri Lanka; the influence of India in the conflict is unknown, although the presence of a sizable Tamil population in southern India may present obstacles to the Sri Lankan Government in putting down this uprising. (S)"
 CIA_SRL.1.d:0 "INDIA’S POSITION ON SRI LANKA: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIndia’s relative geopolitical position to Sri Lanka has presented significant issues to the Sri Lankan Government in its attempt to counter the insurgency by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). With Sri Lanka and India being only 35 miles apart from each other at their closest points, and the appearance of a significant Tamil population in southern India, it is our assessment that the Indian Government will attempt some measure of involvement in the conflict, likely on the side of the Tamil insurgents. (S)\n\nTamil groups, both in Sri Lanka, and in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, have developed strong relationships and cooperation. Specifically, the LTTE has developed relationships with officials from the Pure Tamil Movement and the Kamaraj Congress, as well as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G. Ramachandran, a prominent state official. (S)\n\nThe United States is faced with a challenge in responding to this conflict, and subsequent Indian involvement. It is clear that constraining Indian influence in the region is vital to ensuring that the Sri Lankan Government can continue its counterinsurgency operations unabated. The following are recommendations that can be taken to destabilize Indian influence in the region and take pressure off of Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Using the resources of the International Monetary Fund and other economic organizations to end loan access to the Indian Government\n\n2. Organizing Tamil-majority emigre groups on the Indian mainland, with the intent of forming militant organizations similar to the LTTE in Sri Lanka.\n\n3. Using diplomatic channels to pressure Pakistan into ceasing aid to the Sri Lankan Government, as well as beginning arms shipments to Indian Tamil militant groups.\n\nIt is our hope that this analysis and recommendation will effectively end Indian influence in the region, turn New Delhi’s focus away from their island neighbor, and allow a continuance of the status quo in the area."
 CIA_SRL.2.d:0 "As the Secretary of the Treasury walked into the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund, he was glad that it was so close. Only a short car ride away from the Treasury office buildings, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, it made visits like this simple, and easy, not requiring a flight and more importantly, press.\n\nOnly a few sets of stairs and an elevator ride, and the Secretary was sitting in the office of the Managing Director, the Frenchman Jacques de Larosiere, the most powerful man in the IMF. As the United States representative of the Board of Governors, the Secretary knew he had much influence on the operations of the IMF globally. Having thought over the contents of the CIA report he had read earlier, he knew what was required now.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Secretary. What can I do for you?” de Larosiere leaned back, setting down a cup of coffee on a saucer at his desk, with a view of the DC skyline behind him.\n\n“Jacques, you and I have known each other for a long time. Your leadership at the French Treasury, and now at the IMF, has been excellent. I need a favor from you.” The Secretary adjusted himself as he continued.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen the news or read the briefings from your government. India is increasingly getting involved in the Sri Lankan Civil War, funding the Communist Tamil rebels in the north. They are intentionally sabotaging the conflict and are costing millions of lives in the balance. We recommend that the IMF take action to sanction India for its actions and force them to take pressure off of Sri Lanka.”\n\n“Mr. Secretary. What exactly is your government proposing we do? India is also a consenting member of the IMF. I don’t see why we should get involved in this issue.”“Mr. de Larosiere, you are the Managing Director, the most powerful person in this organization. Our government proposes cutting off access to IMF loans to India. This would not require a vote and could just simply be a procedural matter that you implement, quietly. No press, no scandal, no nothing. It would mean a lot to us, Jacques.”\n\nde Larosiere paused. “Fine, Mr. Secretary. I will see what we can do to end loan access, but no promises. The IMF wants no blowback from this."
 CIA_SRL.3.d:0 "We have received a notification from the International Monetary Fund that our access to IMF loans has been revoked, on the basis of “not following certain criteria for members seeking loans.” While presenting a massive challenge to our fiscal and international economic situation, the Government suspects this may be a move by the IMF, and by the Western bloc as a whole, to sanction our actions in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is unclear how we should respond, other than categorically condemning this action and requesting the IMF reverse its decision. Some figures in our Government have suggested tapering back actions in Sri Lanka, as a means of appeasing the West, but others have maintained the need for self-determination on issues such as these."
 CIA_SRL.4.d:0 "As Jayamravi sat in the small restaurant, he looked around, between the door and his table, to the kitchen, and back again. As he set down the Tamil-language newspaper he was reading, he saw the two men approaching his table, nodding as they sat down. Jayamravi launched straight in.\n\n“I assume you two are here because you’re interested in the local Tiger unit?” He spoke in a hushed tone. The two nodded.\n\nLooking around, Jayamravi stood up, picking up his newspaper, leaving a few rupees on the table, and walking out into the dusty, crowded streets of Madurai, then turning suddenly into an alley, ducking into another alley, and stopping outside a doorway where a man stood. Jayamravi nodded, motioned for the two men to follow, and guided them inside, where a makeshift command center and armory seemed to have been set up.\n\n“Welcome to the local cell of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu, gentlemen. Our fighters have done checks on you and have determined that you are safe. Welcome abroad. We’re glad to have you.” Jayamravi smiled, gesturing to the tables, spread with maps, newspapers, a desk in the back with vests, explosives about to be strapped to them. Jayamravi unholstered a pistol, checking the slide. “I hope you know what you’re getting into.”\n\nWhat no one but only one realized was that “Jayamravi” was really an elaborate cover. CIA operative Shekar smiled. He missed his home, a wonderful suburbia outside of McLean, Virginia, but this mission was far more important. Much more had to be done."
 CIA_SRL.5.d:0 "SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMilitant activity among Tamil nationalist and militant groups has been steadily increasing in the state of Tamil Nadu, including in the major cities of Chennai, Puducherry, and Madurai. The most prominent has probably been the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a militant group almost identically based off of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nIt is not currently known of the connection between the Sri Lanka-based LTTE and the LTTN; however, it can be assumed that connections have taken place. The LTTN primarily operates as an Indian affiliate of the Tamil Tigers, designed to operate in Tamil-majority areas in an attempt to alienate popular support away from current Government assistance to the LTTE.\n\nThe current recommendation of this report is to move forward with basic counter-insurgency operations and heavier policing operations to prevent LTTN cells from committing incursions or other terrorist attacks on sovereign Indian soil. The state of Tamil Nadu should receive all adequate funding and resources necessary to achieve this task."
 CIA_SRL.6.d:0 "DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS TOWARDS INDIA\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBased on our previous assessments, this Office has indicated that instead of further destabilization operations towards India, a change in strategy is required, towards covert diplomatic actions. This office provides the following recommendations, with the cooperation of the US Embassy, New Delhi; and the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Department of State:\n\n1. Covert pressure and threatening to withhold aid, including military aid in the form of possible arms sales and technology transfers, as well as direct economic aid.\n\n2. Placing pressure on US companies operating in India, such as Union Carbide India Limited, to make similar demands, on the basis that India should cease their actions in Sri Lanka if they would like to continue to maintain economic cooperation and growth with US and other Western companies.\n\n3. Working with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to consider placing sanctions and seizing assets of prominent Indian officials, including Cabinet officials, members of the Defense Staff, and personnel at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, on similar basis as stated above.\n\n4. Enforcement of all above sanctions and threats, as well as ensuring support from allies and other Western nations in placing pressure on the Indian Government.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that these recommendations will provide adequate diplomatic weight to persuade India to cease their operations and interference in Sri Lanka."
 CIA_SRL.7.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has come to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Inter-Services Intelligence, to request that we end aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their fight against the communist and Indian-backed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nAmerican officials are apparently focused on halting Indian influence in the region, particularly surrounding Sri Lanka, and have come to us, aware of our feelings towards India, and have asked for us to pursue more direct involvement, in order to perhaps take the Indians’ attention away from the island to the south.\n\nMembers of the Government are unsure about stopping arms shipments to the Sri Lankan Government, and some have argued that we can do both. However, we are dependent on US arms sales and other assistance, and listening to their requests may help us out in the long run."
 CIA_SRL.8.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley, and the State Department, that the Pakistani Government, including Inter-Services Intelligence, intends on continuing aid to the Sri Lankan Government in the form of arms sales and training of military personnel.\n\nWhile this is not what we asked the Pakistanis to do, and while there is some considerable anger in Langley as a result, the continued funding of the Sri Lankan Government by Pakistan still represents a beneficial opportunity to subvert Indian influence via proxy. We can only hope that their rhetoric towards India will toughen in the future."
 CIA_SRL.9.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley that after confidential discussions, the Pakistani Government, under the auspices of Inter-Service Intelligence, has agreed to end covert military aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their counterinsurgency operations against Tamil rebels.\n\nBased on a request from Langley, the Pakistanis have not taken back their physical military shipments, but have stopped them in the future. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to deal with the blowback from the Sri Lankan Government, with our support.\n\nIt is hoped that with this development, we shall be able to further persuade the Pakistanis to refocus their attention on their border with India and inflaming tensions in the Kashmir region, in order to turn the Indians’ attention away from Sri Lanka and back towards their archnemesis, Pakistan."
 CIA_SRL.10.d:0 "TAMIL NADU: POSSIBILITIES FOR OPERATIONS\nStation Chief, New Delhi; Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the United States’ endeavor to assist Sri Lanka in its ongoing civil war, it has become necessary to undertake more escalatory actions in order to prevent India from becoming further involved on the side of the Tamil rebels.\n\nCIA personnel in New Delhi and Colombo have proposed expansion of operations in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which is the closest state to Sri Lanka and contains a Tamil-majority population. This Office believes that the demographic distribution presents a vital factor in committing attacks there, as it will alienate Tamil Indians away from the war, and turn regional public opinion against the Indian-backed LTTE rebels.\n\nCommitting attacks in major cities of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Madurai, using the resources of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), against particular targets such as:\n\n-Pro-war Lok Sahka members,\n-Tamil Nadu state officials,\n-The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n-Prominent social and religious leaders in the state\n\nThis will effectively attract the attention of the Indian central government, distract law enforcement and security forces, and create social divisions between members of the Tamil majority."
 CIA_SRL.11.d:0 "TAMIL NADU SECURITY REPORT\n\nPrime Minister’s Office\n\nThe security situation in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has been contentious in recent weeks. Several attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a Tamil nationalist militant group heavily associated with the Sri Lankan LTTE, have been perpetrated in the major metropolitan areas of Chennai and Madurai.\n\nWhile no major state or central government officials have been killed or injured, the primary targets have been local municipal officials, as well as local police and members of the Tamil Nadu Police. However, intelligence sources indicate that attacks on Lok Sakha and state officials may be incoming, if the government does not act to stop their actions.\n\nLTTN attacks, much like their comrades in Sri Lanka, have focused on suicide attacks using bombs, as well as some limited shooting attacks. Many attacks appear to be pre-planned, indicating that LTTN cells have some knowledge of government and law enforcement operations before they happen.\n\nSome officials in the government have indicated their worry for this situation, particularly as it relates to our involvement in Sri Lanka. Some whisperings have echoed about withdrawal of Indian aid to the LTTE, on the basis that their affiliate organization is waging attacks on the mainland."
 CIA_SRL.12.d:0 "ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA: SUMMARY\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe United States’ decision to support the Sri Lankan Government in its ongoing civil conflict against the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or “Tamil Tigers”) has come with significant costs and benefits to both sides. This Office recommends the following actions in addition to regular diplomatic actions, as a means of reinforcing Sri Lanka’s military capability and effectiveness, as well as halting Indian involvement in the conflict on the side of the LTTE.\n\n1. The immediate implementation of intelligence sharing with the Sri Lankan military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in addition to the Sri Lankan Police Service and other security forces. This will ensure more accurate targeting and hopeful prevention of further terrorist attacks and incursions by LTTE and other Tamil militant groups.\n\n2. Coordination of covert support (lethal and non-lethal) with Pakistan, who has also been active in aiding the Sri Lankan Government\n\n 3. Consideration of additional lethal aid support to the Sri Lankan Government, including training of the Sri Lankan Special Forces Regiment, and lethal aid to government-backed paramilitary groups, including the Muslim Home Guard.\n\nIt is our hope that a combination of this aid will augment the struggling Sri Lankan military and security forces at this present time and increase their counterinsurgency capabilities as they continue to repel attacks and offensives from the LTTE."
 CIA_SRL.13.d:0 "As the Sri Lankan Army major sat in the command headquarters, outside of Colombo, he was sweating, both from the heat and from the nervousness he felt. Assigned to command the security detail for this divisional headquarters, he looked around, into the muggy night. It was quiet, too quiet. As he stepped out of the tent, he saw the barbed wire, the entrance gate, the guard towers flanked with young soldiers, armed with their machine guns. They had been terrorized by Tiger suicide bombings, something the major had never seen before. Security was tight, but never tight enough for them, he thought.\n\nAs he walked back into the tent, he peered over the latest reports, from the local army military intelligence officers. They were remarkably short and useless, providing little to no detail on the Tigers’ activities other than that they exist and continue to commit attacks. He sighed, wondering what the point of the military intelligence corps was. Surely they had to be intelligent, right? Apparently not.\n\nOne of his lieutenants, having sped in on a motorcycle, rushed in, carrying a sheaf of papers in a file. Messily saluting, he exhaustedly pushed the papers toward the major, who opened the file and starting looking through, trying to decipher the awful Sinhalese translation.\n\n“Sir, the American operative embedded with the Military Intelligence Corps has a report on the Tigers’ movements here. He’s warning of an attack tonight, using a truck.” The major looked around, then back down, reading the report.\n\n“Okay. Raise the alert level. Double the guards. Bring up the gate barriers. Tell the troops to prepare for an incurs-” He was interrupted by the sudden rip of automatic weapons fire, seemingly from the outer perimeter, followed by shouts as troops moved towards the skirmish. The major looked out at a truck, stopped, soldiers shooting at it, then moving forward, the gunshots stopping, the driver dead. He looked at his lieutenant, then down at the sheaf of papers. “Holy shit.”"
 CIA_SRL.14.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a possible new ally in the fight for Sri Lanka. Pakistan.” CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] stood in the Oval, surrounded by Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Secretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef], and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv].\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] sat at the Resolute Desk, listening. “Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, Mr. President, the Pakistanis have been covertly funding the Sri Lankan Government since the Civil War kicked off in July of ‘83. As our reports have indicated, the Indians have been funding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil rebels that the government in Colombo is fighting. The Pakistanis have long been foes of India, and have been using this conflict as an opportunity to exercise influence in the region in order to subvert Indian goals.”\n\nThe Secretary of Defense cut in. “Specifically, the Pakistanis have been providing the Sri Lankans with small arms, some explosives, and light patrol vehicles. Their Inter-Services Intelligence service has been providing some limited intelligence, but we think that combining arms transfers from us and intelligence sharing would heavily benefit the Sri Lankans in their fight.”\n\nThe President looked around. “I see no problem with this. What are the chances the Indians find out?”\n\nThe Secretary of State responded. “Our embassy in New Delhi, as well as the CIA chief of station there, have made inquiries discreetly. The Indians have no idea and are preoccupied with tensions in Kashmir as well as funding the Tigers in Sri Lanka.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Excellent. Make it happen, gentlemen. Reach out to the Pakistanis.” The men nodded, as they shook hands, wrote some notes, and left the room to make calls."
 CIA_SRL.15.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed our operatives at Inter-Services Intelligence that the United States is preparing to coordinate covert support to Sri Lanka, in the form of covert arms shipments, intelligence sharing, reconnaissance photos, and diplomatic actions.\n\nAs the US has noticed our help to the Sri Lankan Government, in their fight against Indian-backed Tamil rebels, they have decided to consolidate covert aid to maintain a united front and expand US-Pakistan cooperation. CIA and US military officials are expected to meet with ISI and Air Force officers in the coming days to work out details of a joint US-Pakistan arms shipment network, via air drops as well as cross-sea transfers via ship.\n\nIt is expected that this endeavor will be successful, with the hope that the Indians do not find out our partnership with the Americans."
 CIA_SRL.16.d:0 "FALSE FLAGS IN SRI LANKA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite the ongoing Sri Lankan Civil War, embedded CIA personnel and Sri Lankan Army personnel report a significant drop in combat effectiveness among government forces in recent weeks, out of a lack of morale and a lack of initiative among combat commanders, as well as continuing LTTE attacks on government installations and public buildings. This drop in morale is resulting in continued lack of initiative and therefore, further reduced morale.\n\nThis Office proposes the following recommendations to alleviate this issue and in particular, in ways that do not involve further advising the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, due to the lack of effectiveness with that strategy:\n\n1. Beginning covert support for isolated Tiger cells and other Sri Lankan rebel groups, with the specific mission of committing attacks against Sri Lankan government forces, under specific parameters determined by CIA operatives on the ground.\n\n2. Funding or otherwise supporting possible attacks against significant government buildings in Colombo, as well as against the residences of the Sri Lankan President, Sri Lankan Prime Minister, members of the Sri Lankan Parliament, and significant religious or social figures.\n\n3. Otherwise encouraging “false-flag” type attacks in order to provide the Sri Lankan Government with adequate justification to ramp up operations towards the LTTE forces to the north of the island.\n\nWhile no specific operations have been proposed by this Office, instead leaving that decision to be made by operatives on the ground, these should provide a basic structure to develop specific plans."
 CIA_SRL.17.d:0 "As the 2-ton truck rumbled and bounced down the road, the two drivers kept looking around, anxiously, checking the road, the sides, their rear, for figures poking out of the jungle undergrowth.\n\nThe truck had a red cross on it, indicating they were aid workers, as did their papers, but the drivers knew they were anything but. Presumably, this drive towards Mullaitivu, a town in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, would be somewhat safe, but the “aid workers” still carried concealed pistols, just in case. You could never be too careful.\n\nBouncing along, the truck stopped at what appeared to be a Tiger checkpoint. Mullaitivu was a government stronghold but the route they were taking was still contested, and that seemed clear as they got out of the truck, hands in the air, being searched by the guards, who patted them down while others stood by with Type 56 rifles. Apparently satisfied by their papers, they opened the makeshift checkpoint and the truck carried on, towards Mullaitivu, a few rupees lighter.\n\nReaching the town, the agents waved to the Sri Lankan soldiers, who looked at them warily. Arriving at the local mosque, the truck stopped, with the two men getting out and stretching for a moment before opening the back of the truck. These were certainly “aid supplies” if you considered aid to be several hundred rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The men nodded as members of the community came around, and one of them talked to the leader, apparently of the “Muslim Home Guard,” who started handing out the weapons. The other man climbed back into the truck, hitting the radio.\n\n“Eagle One to HQ. Baby birds have been fed. Distributing the “bird seed” now.”"
 CIA_SRL.18.d:0 "A dispatch from local Army commanders in Mullaitivu, a Government stronghold in the Northern Province at the front lines, has indicated that American operatives, posing as Red Cross aid workers, are arming the Muslim Home Guard, a pro-Government paramilitary group, providing them with rifles and rounds of ammunition.\n\nOur program to form more paramilitary and home defense groups in local municipalities has met with some opposition, particularly since it is hard to recruit willing civilians to defend their towns, as the attrition rate of civilians in this conflict has been particularly high.\n\nHowever, this move by the CIA has indicated that the United States intends to continue supplying both Government forces and affiliated paramilitaries, which hopefully will increase performance and capability to drive out the traitorous Tamil rebels in the north."
