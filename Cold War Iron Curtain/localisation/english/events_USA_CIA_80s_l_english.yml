 # Sri Lankan Civil War
 CIA_SRL.0.d:0 "SRI LANKAN INSURGENCY: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn recent years, tensions between the Sri Lankan Government, dominated by the Sinhalese ethnic group, and the Tamil ethnic group, located in the north of the country, have escalated into violence. Tamils have alleged systemic discrimination against them in employment, education, and language, particularly concerning the 1970s policy of standardization which systematically limited Tamil students from gaining entrance into universities. (U/OU)\n\nThe Tamil opposition to government policy has existed in the form of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), acting as the legitimate political opposition since 1976; while militant groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been formed under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran. Both groups, while differing in their methods, desire for the creation of a secular, socialist state of “Tamil Eelam” located in the Tamil-majority north of the country. (S)\n\nRecent anti-Tamil riots and demonstrations, including one in 1977 that resulted in 125 deaths, and the burning of the Jaffna Public Library in 1981 by a Sinhalese mob, have continually increased tensions towards full civil war. Now, in 1983, the fire has begun to burn bright, particularly after a Sri Lankan Army patrol, known as “Four Four Bravo” was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. The period known as “Black July”, has resulted in multiple anti-Tamil pogroms, massacres of prisoners, and hundreds of deaths. (S)\n\nIt is estimated that the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups will continue to harass and outright fight Sri Lankan Army units. However, the situation is unclear outside of Sri Lanka; the influence of India in the conflict is unknown, although the presence of a sizable Tamil population in southern India may present obstacles to the Sri Lankan Government in putting down this uprising. (S)"
 CIA_SRL.1.d:0 "INDIA’S POSITION ON SRI LANKA: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIndia’s relative geopolitical position to Sri Lanka has presented significant issues to the Sri Lankan Government in its attempt to counter the insurgency by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). With Sri Lanka and India being only 35 miles apart from each other at their closest points, and the appearance of a significant Tamil population in southern India, it is our assessment that the Indian Government will attempt some measure of involvement in the conflict, likely on the side of the Tamil insurgents. (S)\n\nTamil groups, both in Sri Lanka, and in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, have developed strong relationships and cooperation. Specifically, the LTTE has developed relationships with officials from the Pure Tamil Movement and the Kamaraj Congress, as well as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G. Ramachandran, a prominent state official. (S)\n\nThe United States is faced with a challenge in responding to this conflict, and subsequent Indian involvement. It is clear that constraining Indian influence in the region is vital to ensuring that the Sri Lankan Government can continue its counterinsurgency operations unabated. The following are recommendations that can be taken to destabilize Indian influence in the region and take pressure off of Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Using the resources of the International Monetary Fund and other economic organizations to end loan access to the Indian Government\n\n2. Organizing Tamil-majority emigre groups on the Indian mainland, with the intent of forming militant organizations similar to the LTTE in Sri Lanka.\n\n3. Using diplomatic channels to pressure Pakistan into ceasing aid to the Sri Lankan Government, as well as beginning arms shipments to Indian Tamil militant groups.\n\nIt is our hope that this analysis and recommendation will effectively end Indian influence in the region, turn New Delhi’s focus away from their island neighbor, and allow a continuance of the status quo in the area."
 CIA_SRL.2.d:0 "As the Secretary of the Treasury walked into the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund, he was glad that it was so close. Only a short car ride away from the Treasury office buildings, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, it made visits like this simple, and easy, not requiring a flight and more importantly, press.\n\nOnly a few sets of stairs and an elevator ride, and the Secretary was sitting in the office of the Managing Director, the Frenchman Jacques de Larosiere, the most powerful man in the IMF. As the United States representative of the Board of Governors, the Secretary knew he had much influence on the operations of the IMF globally. Having thought over the contents of the CIA report he had read earlier, he knew what was required now.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Secretary. What can I do for you?” de Larosiere leaned back, setting down a cup of coffee on a saucer at his desk, with a view of the DC skyline behind him.\n\n“Jacques, you and I have known each other for a long time. Your leadership at the French Treasury, and now at the IMF, has been excellent. I need a favor from you.” The Secretary adjusted himself as he continued.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen the news or read the briefings from your government. India is increasingly getting involved in the Sri Lankan Civil War, funding the Communist Tamil rebels in the north. They are intentionally sabotaging the conflict and are costing millions of lives in the balance. We recommend that the IMF take action to sanction India for its actions and force them to take pressure off of Sri Lanka.”\n\n“Mr. Secretary. What exactly is your government proposing we do? India is also a consenting member of the IMF. I don’t see why we should get involved in this issue.”“Mr. de Larosiere, you are the Managing Director, the most powerful person in this organization. Our government proposes cutting off access to IMF loans to India. This would not require a vote and could just simply be a procedural matter that you implement, quietly. No press, no scandal, no nothing. It would mean a lot to us, Jacques.”\n\nde Larosiere paused. “Fine, Mr. Secretary. I will see what we can do to end loan access, but no promises. The IMF wants no blowback from this."
 CIA_SRL.3.d:0 "We have received a notification from the International Monetary Fund that our access to IMF loans has been revoked, on the basis of “not following certain criteria for members seeking loans.” While presenting a massive challenge to our fiscal and international economic situation, the Government suspects this may be a move by the IMF, and by the Western bloc as a whole, to sanction our actions in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is unclear how we should respond, other than categorically condemning this action and requesting the IMF reverse its decision. Some figures in our Government have suggested tapering back actions in Sri Lanka, as a means of appeasing the West, but others have maintained the need for self-determination on issues such as these."
 CIA_SRL.4.d:0 "As Jayamravi sat in the small restaurant, he looked around, between the door and his table, to the kitchen, and back again. As he set down the Tamil-language newspaper he was reading, he saw the two men approaching his table, nodding as they sat down. Jayamravi launched straight in.\n\n“I assume you two are here because you’re interested in the local Tiger unit?” He spoke in a hushed tone. The two nodded.\n\nLooking around, Jayamravi stood up, picking up his newspaper, leaving a few rupees on the table, and walking out into the dusty, crowded streets of Madurai, then turning suddenly into an alley, ducking into another alley, and stopping outside a doorway where a man stood. Jayamravi nodded, motioned for the two men to follow, and guided them inside, where a makeshift command center and armory seemed to have been set up.\n\n“Welcome to the local cell of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu, gentlemen. Our fighters have done checks on you and have determined that you are safe. Welcome abroad. We’re glad to have you.” Jayamravi smiled, gesturing to the tables, spread with maps, newspapers, a desk in the back with vests, explosives about to be strapped to them. Jayamravi unholstered a pistol, checking the slide. “I hope you know what you’re getting into.”\n\nWhat no one but only one realized was that “Jayamravi” was really an elaborate cover. CIA operative Shekar smiled. He missed his home, a wonderful suburbia outside of McLean, Virginia, but this mission was far more important. Much more had to be done."
 CIA_SRL.5.d:0 "SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMilitant activity among Tamil nationalist and militant groups has been steadily increasing in the state of Tamil Nadu, including in the major cities of Chennai, Puducherry, and Madurai. The most prominent has probably been the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a militant group almost identically based off of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nIt is not currently known of the connection between the Sri Lanka-based LTTE and the LTTN; however, it can be assumed that connections have taken place. The LTTN primarily operates as an Indian affiliate of the Tamil Tigers, designed to operate in Tamil-majority areas in an attempt to alienate popular support away from current Government assistance to the LTTE.\n\nThe current recommendation of this report is to move forward with basic counter-insurgency operations and heavier policing operations to prevent LTTN cells from committing incursions or other terrorist attacks on sovereign Indian soil. The state of Tamil Nadu should receive all adequate funding and resources necessary to achieve this task."
 CIA_SRL.6.d:0 "DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS TOWARDS INDIA\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBased on our previous assessments, this Office has indicated that instead of further destabilization operations towards India, a change in strategy is required, towards covert diplomatic actions. This office provides the following recommendations, with the cooperation of the US Embassy, New Delhi; and the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Department of State:\n\n1. Covert pressure and threatening to withhold aid, including military aid in the form of possible arms sales and technology transfers, as well as direct economic aid.\n\n2. Placing pressure on US companies operating in India, such as Union Carbide India Limited, to make similar demands, on the basis that India should cease their actions in Sri Lanka if they would like to continue to maintain economic cooperation and growth with US and other Western companies.\n\n3. Working with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to consider placing sanctions and seizing assets of prominent Indian officials, including Cabinet officials, members of the Defense Staff, and personnel at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, on similar basis as stated above.\n\n4. Enforcement of all above sanctions and threats, as well as ensuring support from allies and other Western nations in placing pressure on the Indian Government.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that these recommendations will provide adequate diplomatic weight to persuade India to cease their operations and interference in Sri Lanka."
 CIA_SRL.7.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has come to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Inter-Services Intelligence, to request that we end aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their fight against the communist and Indian-backed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nAmerican officials are apparently focused on halting Indian influence in the region, particularly surrounding Sri Lanka, and have come to us, aware of our feelings towards India, and have asked for us to pursue more direct involvement, in order to perhaps take the Indians’ attention away from the island to the south.\n\nMembers of the Government are unsure about stopping arms shipments to the Sri Lankan Government, and some have argued that we can do both. However, we are dependent on US arms sales and other assistance, and listening to their requests may help us out in the long run."
 CIA_SRL.8.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley, and the State Department, that the Pakistani Government, including Inter-Services Intelligence, intends on continuing aid to the Sri Lankan Government in the form of arms sales and training of military personnel.\n\nWhile this is not what we asked the Pakistanis to do, and while there is some considerable anger in Langley as a result, the continued funding of the Sri Lankan Government by Pakistan still represents a beneficial opportunity to subvert Indian influence via proxy. We can only hope that their rhetoric towards India will toughen in the future."
 CIA_SRL.9.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley that after confidential discussions, the Pakistani Government, under the auspices of Inter-Service Intelligence, has agreed to end covert military aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their counterinsurgency operations against Tamil rebels.\n\nBased on a request from Langley, the Pakistanis have not taken back their physical military shipments, but have stopped them in the future. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to deal with the blowback from the Sri Lankan Government, with our support.\n\nIt is hoped that with this development, we shall be able to further persuade the Pakistanis to refocus their attention on their border with India and inflaming tensions in the Kashmir region, in order to turn the Indians’ attention away from Sri Lanka and back towards their archnemesis, Pakistan."
 CIA_SRL.10.d:0 "TAMIL NADU: POSSIBILITIES FOR OPERATIONS\nStation Chief, New Delhi; Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the United States’ endeavor to assist Sri Lanka in its ongoing civil war, it has become necessary to undertake more escalatory actions in order to prevent India from becoming further involved on the side of the Tamil rebels.\n\nCIA personnel in New Delhi and Colombo have proposed expansion of operations in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which is the closest state to Sri Lanka and contains a Tamil-majority population. This Office believes that the demographic distribution presents a vital factor in committing attacks there, as it will alienate Tamil Indians away from the war, and turn regional public opinion against the Indian-backed LTTE rebels.\n\nCommitting attacks in major cities of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Madurai, using the resources of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), against particular targets such as:\n\n-Pro-war Lok Sahka members,\n-Tamil Nadu state officials,\n-The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n-Prominent social and religious leaders in the state\n\nThis will effectively attract the attention of the Indian central government, distract law enforcement and security forces, and create social divisions between members of the Tamil majority."
 CIA_SRL.11.d:0 "TAMIL NADU SECURITY REPORT\n\nPrime Minister’s Office\n\nThe security situation in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has been contentious in recent weeks. Several attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a Tamil nationalist militant group heavily associated with the Sri Lankan LTTE, have been perpetrated in the major metropolitan areas of Chennai and Madurai.\n\nWhile no major state or central government officials have been killed or injured, the primary targets have been local municipal officials, as well as local police and members of the Tamil Nadu Police. However, intelligence sources indicate that attacks on Lok Sakha and state officials may be incoming, if the government does not act to stop their actions.\n\nLTTN attacks, much like their comrades in Sri Lanka, have focused on suicide attacks using bombs, as well as some limited shooting attacks. Many attacks appear to be pre-planned, indicating that LTTN cells have some knowledge of government and law enforcement operations before they happen.\n\nSome officials in the government have indicated their worry for this situation, particularly as it relates to our involvement in Sri Lanka. Some whisperings have echoed about withdrawal of Indian aid to the LTTE, on the basis that their affiliate organization is waging attacks on the mainland."
 CIA_SRL.12.d:0 "ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA: SUMMARY\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe United States’ decision to support the Sri Lankan Government in its ongoing civil conflict against the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or “Tamil Tigers”) has come with significant costs and benefits to both sides. This Office recommends the following actions in addition to regular diplomatic actions, as a means of reinforcing Sri Lanka’s military capability and effectiveness, as well as halting Indian involvement in the conflict on the side of the LTTE.\n\n1. The immediate implementation of intelligence sharing with the Sri Lankan military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in addition to the Sri Lankan Police Service and other security forces. This will ensure more accurate targeting and hopeful prevention of further terrorist attacks and incursions by LTTE and other Tamil militant groups.\n\n2. Coordination of covert support (lethal and non-lethal) with Pakistan, who has also been active in aiding the Sri Lankan Government\n\n 3. Consideration of additional lethal aid support to the Sri Lankan Government, including training of the Sri Lankan Special Forces Regiment, and lethal aid to government-backed paramilitary groups, including the Muslim Home Guard.\n\nIt is our hope that a combination of this aid will augment the struggling Sri Lankan military and security forces at this present time and increase their counterinsurgency capabilities as they continue to repel attacks and offensives from the LTTE."
 CIA_SRL.13.d:0 "As the Sri Lankan Army major sat in the command headquarters, outside of Colombo, he was sweating, both from the heat and from the nervousness he felt. Assigned to command the security detail for this divisional headquarters, he looked around, into the muggy night. It was quiet, too quiet. As he stepped out of the tent, he saw the barbed wire, the entrance gate, the guard towers flanked with young soldiers, armed with their machine guns. They had been terrorized by Tiger suicide bombings, something the major had never seen before. Security was tight, but never tight enough for them, he thought.\n\nAs he walked back into the tent, he peered over the latest reports, from the local army military intelligence officers. They were remarkably short and useless, providing little to no detail on the Tigers’ activities other than that they exist and continue to commit attacks. He sighed, wondering what the point of the military intelligence corps was. Surely they had to be intelligent, right? Apparently not.\n\nOne of his lieutenants, having sped in on a motorcycle, rushed in, carrying a sheaf of papers in a file. Messily saluting, he exhaustedly pushed the papers toward the major, who opened the file and starting looking through, trying to decipher the awful Sinhalese translation.\n\n“Sir, the American operative embedded with the Military Intelligence Corps has a report on the Tigers’ movements here. He’s warning of an attack tonight, using a truck.” The major looked around, then back down, reading the report.\n\n“Okay. Raise the alert level. Double the guards. Bring up the gate barriers. Tell the troops to prepare for an incurs-” He was interrupted by the sudden rip of automatic weapons fire, seemingly from the outer perimeter, followed by shouts as troops moved towards the skirmish. The major looked out at a truck, stopped, soldiers shooting at it, then moving forward, the gunshots stopping, the driver dead. He looked at his lieutenant, then down at the sheaf of papers. “Holy shit.”"
 CIA_SRL.14.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a possible new ally in the fight for Sri Lanka. Pakistan.” CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] stood in the Oval, surrounded by Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Secretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef], and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv].\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] sat at the Resolute Desk, listening. “Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, Mr. President, the Pakistanis have been covertly funding the Sri Lankan Government since the Civil War kicked off in July of ‘83. As our reports have indicated, the Indians have been funding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil rebels that the government in Colombo is fighting. The Pakistanis have long been foes of India, and have been using this conflict as an opportunity to exercise influence in the region in order to subvert Indian goals.”\n\nThe Secretary of Defense cut in. “Specifically, the Pakistanis have been providing the Sri Lankans with small arms, some explosives, and light patrol vehicles. Their Inter-Services Intelligence service has been providing some limited intelligence, but we think that combining arms transfers from us and intelligence sharing would heavily benefit the Sri Lankans in their fight.”\n\nThe President looked around. “I see no problem with this. What are the chances the Indians find out?”\n\nThe Secretary of State responded. “Our embassy in New Delhi, as well as the CIA chief of station there, have made inquiries discreetly. The Indians have no idea and are preoccupied with tensions in Kashmir as well as funding the Tigers in Sri Lanka.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Excellent. Make it happen, gentlemen. Reach out to the Pakistanis.” The men nodded, as they shook hands, wrote some notes, and left the room to make calls."
 CIA_SRL.15.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed our operatives at Inter-Services Intelligence that the United States is preparing to coordinate covert support to Sri Lanka, in the form of covert arms shipments, intelligence sharing, reconnaissance photos, and diplomatic actions.\n\nAs the US has noticed our help to the Sri Lankan Government, in their fight against Indian-backed Tamil rebels, they have decided to consolidate covert aid to maintain a united front and expand US-Pakistan cooperation. CIA and US military officials are expected to meet with ISI and Air Force officers in the coming days to work out details of a joint US-Pakistan arms shipment network, via air drops as well as cross-sea transfers via ship.\n\nIt is expected that this endeavor will be successful, with the hope that the Indians do not find out our partnership with the Americans."
 CIA_SRL.16.d:0 "FALSE FLAGS IN SRI LANKA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite the ongoing Sri Lankan Civil War, embedded CIA personnel and Sri Lankan Army personnel report a significant drop in combat effectiveness among government forces in recent weeks, out of a lack of morale and a lack of initiative among combat commanders, as well as continuing LTTE attacks on government installations and public buildings. This drop in morale is resulting in continued lack of initiative and therefore, further reduced morale.\n\nThis Office proposes the following recommendations to alleviate this issue and in particular, in ways that do not involve further advising the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, due to the lack of effectiveness with that strategy:\n\n1. Beginning covert support for isolated Tiger cells and other Sri Lankan rebel groups, with the specific mission of committing attacks against Sri Lankan government forces, under specific parameters determined by CIA operatives on the ground.\n\n2. Funding or otherwise supporting possible attacks against significant government buildings in Colombo, as well as against the residences of the Sri Lankan President, Sri Lankan Prime Minister, members of the Sri Lankan Parliament, and significant religious or social figures.\n\n3. Otherwise encouraging “false-flag” type attacks in order to provide the Sri Lankan Government with adequate justification to ramp up operations towards the LTTE forces to the north of the island.\n\nWhile no specific operations have been proposed by this Office, instead leaving that decision to be made by operatives on the ground, these should provide a basic structure to develop specific plans."
 CIA_SRL.17.d:0 "As the 2-ton truck rumbled and bounced down the road, the two drivers kept looking around, anxiously, checking the road, the sides, their rear, for figures poking out of the jungle undergrowth.\n\nThe truck had a red cross on it, indicating they were aid workers, as did their papers, but the drivers knew they were anything but. Presumably, this drive towards Mullaitivu, a town in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, would be somewhat safe, but the “aid workers” still carried concealed pistols, just in case. You could never be too careful.\n\nBouncing along, the truck stopped at what appeared to be a Tiger checkpoint. Mullaitivu was a government stronghold but the route they were taking was still contested, and that seemed clear as they got out of the truck, hands in the air, being searched by the guards, who patted them down while others stood by with Type 56 rifles. Apparently satisfied by their papers, they opened the makeshift checkpoint and the truck carried on, towards Mullaitivu, a few rupees lighter.\n\nReaching the town, the agents waved to the Sri Lankan soldiers, who looked at them warily. Arriving at the local mosque, the truck stopped, with the two men getting out and stretching for a moment before opening the back of the truck. These were certainly “aid supplies” if you considered aid to be several hundred rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The men nodded as members of the community came around, and one of them talked to the leader, apparently of the “Muslim Home Guard,” who started handing out the weapons. The other man climbed back into the truck, hitting the radio.\n\n“Eagle One to HQ. Baby birds have been fed. Distributing the “bird seed” now.”"
 CIA_SRL.18.d:0 "A dispatch from local Army commanders in Mullaitivu, a Government stronghold in the Northern Province at the front lines, has indicated that American operatives, posing as Red Cross aid workers, are arming the Muslim Home Guard, a pro-Government paramilitary group, providing them with rifles and rounds of ammunition.\n\nOur program to form more paramilitary and home defense groups in local municipalities has met with some opposition, particularly since it is hard to recruit willing civilians to defend their towns, as the attrition rate of civilians in this conflict has been particularly high.\n\nHowever, this move by the CIA has indicated that the United States intends to continue supplying both Government forces and affiliated paramilitaries, which hopefully will increase performance and capability to drive out the traitorous Tamil rebels in the north."

 # LATAM War on Drugs (Route A)
 ## Colombia
 CIA_LATAM.0.d:0 "LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe geopolitical region known as Latin America, commonly thought of as stretching from the United States’ border with Mexico, through Central and South America to the southern tip of Patagonia, has experienced intense internal and external crises and conflicts since the end of World War II, and particularly into the late 1970s and 1980s. (U/OU)\n\nUnlike other intelligence and analysis operations around the world, the Latin American region presents a unique challenge to US policymakers due to its location and current heavy American influence in the region. In particular, several issues dominate, including internal conflicts in Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua, and others. This Office has provided some recommendations for overall strategies in the region. (S)\n\n1. Maintaining the current United States policy of a strictly anti-Communist stance in the region. This may involve continuing contacts and operations in support of anti-Communist drug cartels and cocaine trafficking rings in the region, including MAS, as well as the Panamanian Government led by General Manuel Noreiga.\n\n2. Escalating the stated policy initiative known as the War on Drugs, chiefly by becoming involved in the internal conflict in Colombia, as well as increasing CIA operations on the southern border and within Mexico. This will involve more irregular operations, as well as operations in support of anti-Communist and anti-Cartel government forces in those selected regions.\n\n3. A less radical and violence approach, consisting of advocating for self-determination initiatives in the Latin American region. This would involve subtle silencing of Communist dissent, as well as ending any support for drug movements, and beginning operations against corporate influence in the region.\n\nThis Office strongly endorses all three of the above outlined strategies and is eager to begin its crucial work of securing American interests in the crucial region to its south."
 CIA_LATAMa.0.d:0 "It was a rainy morning in the Oval Office as President [USA.GetLeader] sat in the Oval, surrounded by CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, and several aides and officials from each office and agency, who were busy setting up a poster on a stand facing the desk and couches.\n\n“Mr. President, our decision to escalate the current War on Drugs campaign in Latin America has come with some challenges and benefits. However, our analysis has pointed to two large areas of focus: Colombia and Mexico.”\n\n“Colombia is currently in the middle of internal conflict which has commenced since the mid 1960’s. The two largest sides, the Government of Colombia, as well as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), have devastated much of the country and have caused regional drug cartels, such as the Cali Cartel and the Medellin Cartel, to arise in rural areas and begin their large-scale production of cocaine, which they traffick north to the United States. Operations in this area, which could consist of either covert or overt interventions, can cut the cocaine crisis off at its source.”\n\nThe President nodded. “I see. Now tell me about Mexico.”\n\n“The situation in Mexico is somewhat similar, and the relatively close location allows greater flexibility in operations. Mexico has become a prime staging point for the movement of cocaine from its manufacturing points in Colombia, and particularly from that of the Guadalajara Cartel, who has turned from trafficking through Florida to cross-border trafficking via points in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California.”\n\nThe FBI Director spoke up. “I can speak for the Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Administration that we are highly looking forward to engaging drug trafficking operations on the border and assisting the CIA in any operation they plan to deal with this terrible issue.”\n\nThe President spoke up. “Excellent, gentlemen. I’m excited to see where this goes. You all know to keep me updated, and specifically if I have to approve any operations, I expect reports daily.” The men nodded, as the poster disappeared with them, leaving the President leafing through the briefing left on his desk."
 CIA_LATAMa.1.d:0 "THE COLOMBIAN CONFLICT: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nHaving gone on since 1964, the Colombian conflict has had its roots in a period of repression known as La Violencia, having occurred from 1948 to 1964, where left-wing and right-wing groups consistently clashed. Now, in the 1980s, the Colombian conflict has reached new heights, with multiple belligerents and the addition of drug cartels and other paramilitary groups becoming involved. (S)\n\nThe major players in the conflict include the anti-Communist Government of Colombia, including the police and military, which is supported by most friendly anti-Communist countries in Latin America as well as the United States. The major insurgent groups include the Communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia People’s Army (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), the urban-based 19th of April Movement (M-19), most of whom are left-wing groups supported and assisted by the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, and other Socialist countries. (S)\n\nThe conflict has been further complicated by the large Colombian cocaine production and distribution capability which, in the midst of this civil conflict, has been co-opted by strong and well-armed drug cartels; the most infamous being the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel, and MAS. These groups are typically anti-Communist, but remain ideologically neutral, instead focusing on profits and preventing government enforcement of the law. (S)\n\nIt is in this environment that the United States is challenged to respond. This Office hereby recommends both covert and overt proposals for operations, recognizing that the former may guarantee plausible deniability, but that the latter may increase efficiency of anti-drug operations overall."
 CIA_LATAMa.2.d:0 "OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA: PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nColombia Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nWhile it is clear that the United States should ally itself with the Government of Colombia in the ongoing conflict, expanding operations against both Communist guerrilla groups, as well as drug cartels, such as the Medellin Cartel, would ensure continuing US influence in Colombia and destroy any capability for cocaine production and trafficking into the United States.\n\n1. Offensive operations should primarily be conducted against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Formed in 1964 as a result of government attacks on Communist militias, FARC is the single largest Communist paramilitary group in Colombia, and has spread out over primarily rural areas in cells throughout the country. This Office recommends embedding in local FARC cells, committing attacks against FARC units in the form of bombings and targeted assassinations of officials, in order to stoke internal dissent and prevent the organization from achieving its goal of unifying to present a conventional threat to Colombian regular forces.\n\n2. Additional supporting operations should be directed towards the Alianza Americana Anticomunista (American Anticommunist Alliance, or AAA), which is a right-wing, anti-Communist paramilitary group associated with Colombian military intelligence. Operating in support of regular Colombian National Army forces, the AAA has been implicated in a 1978 bombing of the Colombian Communist Party’s headquarters, as well as their newspaper. CIA assistance would involve arms shipments of small arms, advisors, and possible intelligence sharing.\n\n3. Lastly, the destruction of coca fields should also be accomplished. This strategy, including burning fields, cutting plants, or spraying plots from airplane using chemicals. CIA forces, supplemented by Colombian Air Force units, should be able to accomplish these operations, which are designed to eliminate drug cartel operations in Colombia and prevent funding to be provided to FARC and other Communist militias.\n\nSpecific proposals on each operation should be delegated to Colombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Operations, and should be cleared with the Directorate for Analysis and the Director before being forwarded to Special Activities Division."
 CIA_LATAMa.3.d:0 "“Mr. President, the CIA Director has some news on Colombia.”\n“Send him in, and thank you.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] smiled, shaking hands with [GetCurrentCIADir] as they sat down at the Resolute desk, the Director pulling out a file from his briefcase and laying it on the table.\n\n“Mr. President, with your approval, the CIA would like to begin extended operations against the FARC in Colombia.”\n\n“Very well. Update me on who FARC is again.”\n\n“Mr. President, FARC is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. They are a Communist guerrilla group currently fighting the Government of Colombia, whom we back. We intend on expanding offensive operations against them by providing further funding and support to the Government of Colombia, as well as escalating covert actions such as embedding agents into FARC cells and conducting targeted assassinations of FARC leaders and prominent figures to cause dissent in the movement.”\n\n“Very well. What is the CIA's prediction of these operations being successful?”\n\n“Very high, Mr. President. We hope that in particular with the assassinations, FARC will become internally divided and may split into warring factions which the Colombian Government will be better equipped to handle. As well, the CIA plans on cooperating with the government on a nationwide anti-FARC campaign in order to show the damage and destruction they have caused to the people of Colombia.”\n\n“Good, Director. This is approved. Please keep me updated on all events.” The President signed a piece of paper, as the Director smiled, placing his file back into his briefcase and preparing to leave. “Thank you, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.4.d:0 "As Jimmy banked the Air Tractor AT-301 slightly, he yawned, rubbing his eyes as he checked the compass and the map laying in his lap to confirm his heading. He had just passed over the small city of Pasto, in the southwestern Narino Department of Colombia, and as his turboprop winged above the mountains at 10,000 feet, he felt lonely.\n\nIt was approximately two in the morning, Bogota time, and as Jimmy continued to fly, he re-checked his tank indicator gauge, making sure that the tank was full of glyphosate herbicide, as well as dropping altitude to approach his series of targets; three coca fields, spaced roughly a klick or two apart, in the Patia valley.\n\nSquinting to make out the first one, Jimmy smiled as he saw a flashing light, pointing out his forward air controller squad, code-named “AGUILA”, who was tasked with distracting the cartel men and signaling the sprayer plane. Jimmy heard some automatic weapons fire as he began his pass, unsure whether it was AGUILA or the Medellin men. He smiled and waved at nobody as he dropped to 200 feet, punching the “drop” button to let loose some 100 gallons of herbicide into a fine mist over the coca plants, before pulling back up to a safe altitude, to do it two more times.\n\nAs he completed his last run, pulling to 10,000 feet once again, Jimmy was reminded of his first days as a crop duster in the Midwest, flying routine spraying missions, when he was stopped by a CIA recruiter. “How would you like to do some work for us down south, son?”"
 CIA_LATAMa.5.d:0 "As President [USA.GetLeader] walked back into the Oval after a short break between meetings, he was nonetheless surprised to see further charts being set up on tripods near his desk, and aides fluttering about, handing out folders and packets.\n\n“Mr. President, we believe that the situation in the Colombian conflict has deteriorated to such a degree that US intervention is necessary to support our goals and the goals of the Colombian Government.” National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] spoke up first, breaking the silence in the room.\n\nCIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] spoke up next. “Sir, our embedded operatives have strongly urged more offensive operations. The Colombian Government is fumbling, and is struggling to contain both FARC and the other Communist militia groups, as well as multiple drug cartels that are competing for influence and ability to distribute cocaine. Our operations can help, but can only go so far.”\n\nSecretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef] nodded. “We have begun implementing and adjusting contingency operations for Colombia. State can tell you more, but the Pentagon has tasked US Southern Command to take primary control of military operations. Preliminary recommendations include the use of air strikes and intelligence sharing against FARC forces, in order to allow Colombian forces to engage Cartel groups.”\n\nThe President finally found a chance to speak up. “Give me the diplomatic angle before I clear any military action. This situation is complicated enough as it is.”\n\nSecretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] broke in. “Our diplomatic relations with the Colombians have been cordial and effective. Our Ambassador in Bogota reports that US military and political assistance to Colombia has been successful thus far, but that the military faces a large corruption problem. He recommends dealing with that by halting some aid in exchange for reforms.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Very well. Thank you all, folks. Keep me updated, and I want regularly updated reports and plans from the Pentagon and Joint Chiefs. Nothing military-oriented happens without my signoff.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.6.d:0 "Based on a rather threatening request by the American Ambassador, our top generals have instituted an anti-corruption initiative within the Military Forces of Colombia. Presumably as a part of pressure initiated by the Americans, who have been providing millions of dollars worth of aid and advising, the top military commanders have created an “Anti-Corruption Unit” which will go about investigating petty and major corruption, particularly among officers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nIt is hoped that this will go somewhere, as the commanders have pressure to maintain it and allow the unit some autonomy, as it will report both to the Colombian General Staff and the President, as well as issue some limited reports to the American Embassy in Bogota."
 CIA_LATAMa.7.d:0 "“Hello?”\n“Secretary, this is Embassy Bogota. The Ambassador would like a word.” The phone clicked as the line changed to the US Ambassador to Colombia.“Secretary, hope you’re doing well this morning.”\n“Yes, Ambassador, I am. What’s this about?”\n“The Colombians have asked that we get further involved in the conflict, besides our current policy of providing overt military assistance in the form of assets and advisors. I’m hesitant to call the Pentagon as our Defense Attache really wants them to deploy troops and I don’t want to escalate.”\n“Very well, Ambassador, thank you. What do we suggest that State does in the meantime, in order to possibly hold off the Pentagon and USSOUTHCOM?”\n\n“Secretary, I think we should designate FARC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization; you have authority to designate groups under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. We then make multiple statements; I make one, you make one, the Pentagon makes one. It looks like we have a united front, we don’t necessarily have to have POTUS’s permission, but we can read him in. It would be “symbolically” declaring war on FARC without pushing it through the Oval Office or the Hill.”\n\n“And the Colombians?” The Secretary frowned into the phone.\n“They won’t know the difference. All they’ll hear is “declare war” and take it literally, and then the Pentagon can start deploying small numbers of troops to Colombia from Panama or Florida.”\n“Okay. Thank you Ambassador, I appreciate your forwardness. I’ll consult with staff and we’ll move on this as soon as possible. Thanks again. Goodbye.”\n\nHe put down the phone, sighing but thinking about what he had just heard. A genius idea."
 CIA_LATAMa.8.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, simultaneous statements from Foggy Bottom and the Pentagon were released today, as the United States Secretary of State officially listed the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In tandem, the Pentagon announced further defensive aid for the Colombian government in its fight against FARC, as well as sending further assets, advisors, and units of the United States Southern Command to task in Colombia. Facing normal praise in the West and criticism in the East, Colombia has welcomed this announcement as tacit American involvement in the conflict."

Units and detachments of the 24th Composite Wing, based from Howard Air Force Base in Panama, are authorized to engage all installations and headquarters of the Medellin and Cali Cartels in southwestern Colombia. The 24th Composite Wing Commander is authorized to use all available aircraft, including but not limited to A-7 Corsairs, C-130 Hercules, O-2 Skymasters, and UH-1 Huey helicopters.\n\n2. Units of United States Navy Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2), based on USS Ranger (CV-61); including Fighter Squadrons 1 and 2, Attack Squadrons 25, 113, and 145 armed with A-6E Intruders and F-14 Tomcats, are authorized for similar strikes on Medellin and Cali cartel installations on the western coast of Colombia, in cooperation with Air Force flights.\n\n3. Support units of Joint Task Force Bravo, stationed in Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras, along with all other support units from USAF Southern Air Division and Carrier Air Wing Two, are authorized to provide airfield and aircraft maintenance, weapons handling, target verification, and other support services.\n\nAll USN and USAF Commanders will independently select and verify target lists based on CIA and DIA intelligence reports and embedded personnel.

 CIA_LATAMa.10.d:0 "Today, a Department of Defense spokesman at the Pentagon announced the official expansion of US air operations in Colombia against major drug cartels in the region. Designating United States Southern Command, based in Doral, Florida, as the primary command for these operations, the Pentagon stated the reason for these strikes was to “protect American interests and partners in Latin America, ensure the end of cocaine trafficking in the region, and to assist the Military Forces of Colombia in their ongoing counterinsurgency mission.”\n\nAccording to further briefings from US Southern Command spokesmen, units involved include the 24th Composite Wing of the United States Air Force based out of Panama, as well as squadrons based from the USS Ranger carrier group, which intends to operate off the coast of Colombia. Reactions to this have been mixed, but the messaging has primarily been of assistance to the Colombian government, and of counter-drug enforcement operations which serve to assist all parties, regardless of ideology."
 CIA_LATAMa.11.d:0 "FARC INTELLIGENCE REPORT FNSJBFB-NN\n[GetDateText]\n\nThe latest intelligence from our cells, spread out throughout the country, have indicated the following information, specifically about expanded American air operations against our targets and Cartel targets.\n\nCells have reported spotting several types of American aircraft, including A-6 Intruders, A-7 Corsairs, C-130 cargo aircraft, and many UH-1 Huey gunships and utility helicopters. The presence of A-6 fighter aircraft, which are carrier-capable, suggests that the Americans are running some operations from a carrier group off the Colombian coast. The other aircraft appear to either be based from somewhere in Panama, or local aircraft stationed at Colombian military bases.\n\nFARC and friendly militia installations and camps have generally not been targeted by American forces, although a few cells have been affected by collateral damage or have lost weapons caches and vehicles. The Americans appear to be attacking Cartel positions, focusing on the Medellin and Cali Cartels who operate in western and southern Colombia, as their focus appears to be counter-drug enforcement operations, as opposed to standard counterinsurgency operations, against a force such as ours.\n\nSome regional leaders have expressed concern that these ongoing American operations will allow the Colombian regular forces to concentrate on FARC units, as well as deny our organization crucial funds required to keep the fight going. However, our capability remains high and we will persevere despite these imperialists bombing our land."
 CIA_LATAMa.12.d:0 "The analysts sat around the table, sipping coffee and waiting as CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] came in, only a short step from his office on the 7th floor of the Original Headquarters Building, at Langley.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen.” The Director smiled and shut the door. “Let’s get right into it. Tell me everything you know about Pablo Escobar.”\n\n“Yes, Director. His full name is Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria. Born December 1949, raised in the city of Medellin, in northwestern Colombia. Heavily involved in criminal enterprises since he was a teenager, including stealing cars and kidnapping of businessmen. First arrested in 1976 by the Colombian Security Service for trafficking cocaine from Ecuador. Escobar began to assert his influence, turning to bribery and assassination of officials, hiring gunmen and trafficking ever-increasing amounts of cocaine out of Colombia, and north into the United States, initially through Miami and the Bahamas.”\n\n“The corresponding cocaine boom in the early part of this decade has only increased demand for cocaine from Colombia, and has increased competition between Escobar’s Medellin Cartel, and their rival, the Cali Cartel. However, Escobar and his men appear to be caught in the middle. They oppose both the Colombian Government who wants to restore security, while also opposing FARC and remaining against Communist interference. According to Ops, CIA has tried to contact Escobar to seek cooperation, but has thus far failed. The Agency must come to a decision on what to do with him, and fast.”\n\n“Thank you, gentlemen. I see. Are you proposing we take out Escobar and his lieutenants?”\n“Yes, sir. DEA, understandably, and FBI are all over this idea; but they don’t have the resources or pull to make it work themselves. They know the CIA has the influence and funding, and we’ve done assassinations successfully in the past.”\n“So what’s the plan?”\n\n“Ops has proposed tracking Escobar’s movements for the next few weeks to establish a pattern of analysis as to where he and his lieutenants go; alternating between his home city of Medellin, and various homes that he owns in Cartagena, Colombia, and one in Miami. It may be that he lets down his guard enough to take a weekend off and that’s when we strike. Operatives from CIA, DEA, MACV-SOG, et cetera, will organize a strike proposal option, likely at his property at Cartagena, where we take Escobar, preferably alive, but dead will work as well.”\n\n“Very well. We will not read the President on this unless absolutely necessary.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.13.d:0 "USE OF ANTI-COMMUNIST CARTELS IN COLOMBIA\nColombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe situation of drug trafficking cartels in Colombia has presented an unusual situation for all involved parties, including the United States, in protecting US interests. While most cartels maintain an anti-communist ideology in the frame of expanding profit margins for their cocaine trafficking operations, they also must contend with continual interference and attacks from the Colombian Government, as well as share some practical ideals with Communist militias and other groups.\n\nIt is the opinion of this Office that certain large non-Communist cartel groups, such as the Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar, should be co-opted and folded into a general, government led, anti-communist alliance. This Office believes that the Cartels already have the money, distribution networks, and weapons required to combat FARC and other Communist militias, and if we are able to make deals with major cartels (on issues such as cocaine distribution and/or immunity from prosecution) we may be able to receive further Cartel aid and reduce the number of belligerents in the conflict. Consolidation must be key."
 ## Mexico
 CIA_LATAMa.14.d:0 "SITUATION UPDATE: MEXICO DESK\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite other conflicts and tumult occurring in the majority of the Latin American world, the US neighbor to the south, Mexico, is facing a unique situation as well. While maintaining rather cordial relations with the United States, Mexico is single-handedly responsible for the transshipment of over 50% of US imports of marijuana and heroin, both Schedule I controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nThe Mexican Government, led by President [MEX.GetLeader] is facing similar drug control problems as do nations further south, such as Colombia. Use of herbicide spraying and involvement of the Mexican Armed Forces in drug enforcement operations has proven unsuccessful, as the country remains a central point for both production of marijuana and heroin, as well as a staging point for trafficking of cocaine from other states, including Colombia. However, it is worth noting that unlike other Latin American drug-producing states, the Mexican population consumes very little of the drugs that it produces and trafficks.\n\nUnited States policy until now has been to force diplomatic pressure on the Mexican government to adopt more stringent control measures, which it has done most of the time, with varying degrees of effectiveness. This Office, along with other Mexican-focused offices and desks of the intelligence community and State Department, has proposed two possible changes in strategy to assist Mexico in its ongoing drug problem, and to advance American interests in the region.\n\n1. The United States could begin a covert approach to Mexico, operating to engage cartels without the knowledge of the Mexican government. This may be preferable instead of attempting to diplomatically pressure the Mexicans, and potential operations might include training of anti-Cartel militias, covert assaults on Cartel bases and installations, and an increase of DEA operations and funding.\n\n2. American policymakers might also consider a possible intervention in Mexico in order to forcefully stabilize the situation. It is hoped that this would be an international intervention and may involve a United Nations process. It is imperative that the Mexican government be consulted in this, in order to maintain friendly relations with Mexico and ensure no ill will. If Mexico is willing to accept international observers and aid, they will be better equipped to handle the drug issue.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that one of the two strategies will properly align the United States toward a path of good drug enforcement and adequately stabilize the drug situation in Latin and Central America."
 CIA_LATAMa.15.d:0 "COVERT APPROACHES IN MEXICO\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs relations between the United States and Mexico have deteriorated, the US intelligence community and State Department has determined that a covert strategy in the ongoing drug war is the next step in American policy as concerns Mexico and drug enforcement operations. This Office recommends the following:\n\n1. Training anti-Cartel militia units, also known as autonomous self-units, in municipalities and cities, specifically where Cartel activity is known to be high. The purpose of this is to train local Mexican citizens to defend their communities and to provide local autonomy in anti-Cartel operations, devolving authority to local governments.\n\n2. Conducting special forces raids on Cartel bases and installations; using resources of CIA, DIA, Delta Force, and SEALs, strategically attacking, raiding, arresting, and killing Cartel leaders and lieutenants, as well as delivery drivers and convoys, in order to interdict and send a message to Cartels that the US means business.\n\n3. Expansion of DEA border funding, as well as Border Patrol resources. This funding, pulled from already-appropriated CIA funding, would provide DEA and Border Patrol resources to continue to interdict and arrest Cartel members and drug trafficking through the US border and ports of entry, as well as approving additional jurisdictional powers for those agencies to continue their operations.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that further covert operations and cooperation with relevant US and Mexican agencies and officials will effectively interdict drug manufacturing and trafficking in Mexico, thereby stopping the flow of drugs into the southern United States and protecting our security at home and abroad."
 CIA_LATAMa.17.d:0 "It was dusk in the desert, and as the sun slipped below the horizon, the hot temperatures quickly began to cool. Thank god for that, Mason thought as he sipped on a bottle of water, waiting for it to get darker. He was sitting in a Ford Econovan, with Mexican plates of course.\n\n“Hey Gene, how’s it looking back there?”\n\nGene, his partner operative, nodded. “Looking good, boss!” He checked the hastily equipped surveillance equipment again, before loading the last bullet into his SIG Sauer P220 pistol, sliding the other loaded one across the floor to Pickett.\n\nThe radio crackled to life again, indicating the near presence of the assault team. “Overwatch, this is Dog One. Dog One, approaching LZ. Situation report, come on!”\n\nGene picked back up. “Dog One, this is Overwatch. Target Alpha all clear. Cleared to storm. Storm, storm, storm.”\n\nJust as he had finished, three Hughes 500D helicopters shot over the van, about 50 feet above them, coming to a landing inside the courtyard of the Cartel compound. Five soldiers, clinging to each chopper, jumped off, taking tactical positions, as the choppers lifted back off, providing covering fire from the air.\n\nGene and Mason moved out of their position as well, as the van pulled forward from its hidden position and stopped, fishtailing outside the entrance. The two CIA agents, rushing towards the courtyard, fought their way to the DEA assault team, who were busy laying fire down, arresting surrendering Cartel members, and inspecting the bodies of the handful they had killed on the way down.\n\n“Looks like we struck at the perfect time.” Mason said, taking a second to reload his pistol before moving to clear another room."
 CIA_LATAMa.18.d:0 "It was a cloudy morning in Washington as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency walked into the DEA headquarters building, located at 1405 I Street, only blocks from the White House and National Mall. As he got upstairs, to the top floor, entering his office, there was a note on his desk from his secretary, something about a call to his office from an unknown number, asking to speak to him. Most calls were screened, but this was from a government phone.\n\nGetting to work on some reports, the phone rang about 20 minutes later. He picked it up, expecting any number of people on the other end; his wife, a subordinate, et cetera.\n\n“Hello?”\n“Is this the DEA Administrator?”\n“Yes, to whom am I speaking?”\n“This is Langley. Check your operating budget accounts. There should be some new funds in there, in the neighborhood of $20 million. You’re welcome.”\n“What?”\nClick.\n\nThe DEA Administrator just looked around, before setting the receiver down. What the hell, he thought. More money to do drug interdiction programs, I guess, he thought a second later."
 CIA_LATAMa.19.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a proposal on a solution to the Mexico issue.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] paused from whatever business he had been attending to before, surely something less important than whatever was going to emerge from CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir]’s mouth. The Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState] was standing behind him, so that had to mean something.\n\n“Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, sir, the CIA has run an analysis of the situation in Mexico, US policy, and they’ve come up with an alternative to what we’re doing now. We propose an international intervention, either led by the United States or the United Nations, into Mexico, in order to stabilize the internal situation as well as provide crucial counter-drug and interdiction operational capabilities.”\n\n“I see. Do we plan to read the Mexicans in on this, Secretary?”\n\nThe Secretary of State nodded. “Yes, sir. We plan to make an announcement as well as an inquiry through the US Ambassador in Mexico City, with their options being that we will provide them aid and training, or if they refuse, we will attempt to find an international consensus via the United Nations and Organization of American States.”\n\n“I see. Consider this signed off, gentlemen. I presume the other alternative was to continue covert operations in Mexico?”\n“Yes, sir. We had considered that, but seeing as our relations with the Mexicans appear to be good right now, the diplomatic option may be preferable.”\n“Very well. Thank you, gentlemen.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President.” The two men exited out of the Oval, and glancing at each other, stood in the corridor for a minute. “Secretary, I hope you know what you’re getting into. Might want to get international support now while you can.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.20.d:0 "The US Ambassador to Mexico has come to our Secretariat of Foreign Affairs and Secretariat of Defense with a proposal to combat our ongoing drug enforcement problem in the country.\n\nThe White House, apparently concerned with our ineffectiveness in combating Cartel drug production and trafficking operations in Mexico, has proposed an international intervention in Mexico in order to stabilize the situation and to allow for assistance to the government to improve the enforcement.\n\nThe Americans have offered international law enforcement aid in the form of funding as well as cross-border cooperation in interdiction, but some officials within the government are concerned that allowing the Americans to dictate drug policy in their own country is invasive and counterproductive to political goals. However, the US Ambassador made clear that all in all, the US will get involved, like it or not. A crucial decision must be made, whether to enlist their help or to stand firm against Yankee domination over our affairs."
 CIA_LATAMa.21.d:0 "After a short conference with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington, indicating that the Mexican Government is open to American aid with drug enforcement operations.\n\nApparently seen as a quite controversial topic in some corners of Mexican political life, the issue was seen as a net benefit, and already, American DEA and Mexican Federal Police have met to discuss border cooperation and possible operations. Intelligence sharing is also expected to take place, and the Pentagon has already floated deploying some military advisors and security personnel to assist with the Mexican Secretariat for Defense.\n\nLatin American analysts have expressed optimism for the future, hoping that further US-Mexican cooperation will stop major Cartels from continuing their influence in Mexican politics, and halt the rapidly increasing drug problem in the United States."
 CIA_LATAMa.22.d:0 "After a terse meeting with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington that the Mexicans are staunchly against an American intervention or assistance in their country, on the grounds that further American influence in their country will continue to erode the political and social situation as well as continue the ongoing drug problem.\n\nThe Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs has included a public statement, revealing the plan, harshly condemning the request as “a nicely framed tactic of American imperialism in Latin America,” and that “Mexico will not be co-opted for American interests further south. We can deal with the ongoing drug trafficking problem ourselves without US or international interference.”\n\nOfficials in the intelligence and defense communities have reportedly been furious, along with President [USA.GetLeader] being briefed about the ongoing developments. It is clear that if the Mexicans will not comply, we will make them comply by all means necessary; even if it means turning to the international community."
 CIA_LATAMa.23.d:0 "In Mexico City today, a spokesman for the Mexican Secretariat for Foreign Affairs confirmed the previously unsubstantiated reports that the United States was seeking an intervention in Mexico against the ongoing drug cartel crisis. Mexican officials unequivocally condemned any possible intervention as “American imperialism in Latin America, the likes of which have been seen before in Brazil, Guatemala, and Cuba.”\n\nAmerican officials are reportedly disappointed by this development, but have vowed to continue on with a possible intervention. Some pundits have posited that the United Nations, or the Organization for American States may be contacted, but time will tell."
 CIA_LATAMa.24.d:0 "It was a sunny day as President [USA.GetLeader] gathered with his staff and subordinates for a small but formal ceremony. Gathered were the Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState], CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, the DEA Administrator, and the Chief of the Border Patrol.\n\nThey were all assembled there, no press, yet, because the President was signing an important, yet somewhat archaic and traditional, document; a presidential proclamation. But this was no ordinary proclamation; one that would also be accompanied by a joint resolution of Congress confirming its contents; a presidential proclamation declaring the United Mexican States to be a narco state, a country operating around the business of producing and trafficking drugs.\n\n“By the authority invested in me as President of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim the following:\nBecoming more rapidly concerned over increased flows of marijuana and heroin into the United States via its border with Mexico;\nConcerned that Mexican law enforcement and military units are not effective nor capable of engaging in the Cartels on their own;\nRecognizing the integral role that corruption, particularly of Cartel influence, in the Mexican political system plays in the above effectiveness of law enforcement in drug interdiction operations;\nI, as President of the United States of America, declare and proclaim that the United Mexican States is now considered a narco state under the above facts, and issues all warnings to civilians via relevant sources, such as the Department of State, of the dangers of traveling to Mexico for their own safety.”\n\nThe President sighed as he signed his name to the proclamation, knowing full well that this would only be the beginning to what was surely going to be an interesting situation for his administration."
 CIA_LATAMa.25.d:0 "As Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] sat in his office, he checked his schedule, before hearing a buzz from his outside secretary.\n“Secretary, you have calls from Ambassadors and Latin America Desk on lines one through four.”\n\nPicking up the phone, he hit “LINE 1”.\n\n“Good morning Ambassador, how are you? What’s the situation in London?”\n“Secretary, the British seem ambivalent about supporting an international drug enforcement mission. They have little influence or reason to get involved in Mexico, but the Foreign Secretary didn’t indicate that they’d vote against it.”\n\n“Very good, thanks Ambassador. Have a good day.” The Secretary murmured a goodbye before hitting “LINE 2”.\n“Ambassador, how is it looking in Paris?”\n“Secretary, the French are interested in contributing to a drug monitoring mission. They said they won’t vote against it in the Security Council.”\n“Very good, thanks.” The Secretary tersely switched to “LINE 3”.\n\n“Secretary, I know what you’re going to ask. The Brazilians, Argentinians, and Chileans are all in support of your program. The Colombians might be, but as you know they’re bogged down at the moment. Most of Central America is also in support except for Nicaragua, of course.”\n\n“Thank you, Latin America Desk. Keep your analyses going. Have a good day.” The Secretary felt bad but he had to keep this short, switching to his last call, “LINE 4,” the Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n“Mr. Ambassador, how is your work going in New York?”\n\n“Secretary, it’s been mixed. The Mission and I have been working around the clock to contact the other Missions here and get them on board, particularly the Security Council members and the Eastern Bloc, but very little luck so far. Many members outside of Latin America either do not care or consider it further US imperialism. We are trying our best, Secretary, and are working on language for a draft resolution right now.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Keep up your good work and keep up the reports. If you need a call from me, patch it through my office. The President wants this to happen and god damn it, I’m going to try to make this work.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.26.d:0 "It was the regular meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and as the members entered the meeting room of the Council in New York, they began to suspect a trap. The American representative, having already arrived, was going over papers, aides standing nearby. They looked up as the Soviet, Chinese, British, French, and non-permanent representatives sat down, being gaveled into order by the chair. Typically, the American Ambassador stood up first, launching immediately into their speech.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen of the Security Council, today I called a meeting to discuss an issue which the United Nations has dealt with before. Our neighbor to the south, Mexico, has had a continual drug enforcement problem, with multiple large cartels producing and trafficking marijuana and heroin across the border into the United States. This is affecting our youth, causing hundreds of deaths and addiction on both sides of the border, and providing organized crime with millions of dollars for their own uses.”\n\n“The Mexican government has attempted to use their law enforcement and military sources to counter these cartels but has been ineffective in this goal. The United States has tried to request to help, but the Mexican government has resisted our advances at every turn. This is an issue which not only affects us, but the entire Latin American region, if not the entire world. The War on Drugs is an international issue, and one that we, as a global leader, want to solve, with the assistance of the UN.”\n\n“As the American representative to the United Nations Security Council, I hereby place the following resolution onto the table, to condemn the drug crisis in Mexico, authorize a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and authorize the United States to take action to restore the rule of law in Mexico and eliminate drug trafficking operations.”\n\nSitting back down, the entire room erupted in a low murmur. As the American delegation sat in their corner of the room, they knew that this would only be the beginning."
 CIA_LATAMa.27.d:0 "Surprise at the United Nations in New York came today as the United States Permanent Representative on the Security Council approached the body and submitted a draft resolution concerning the ongoing drug crisis in the region.\n\nSubmitted days after the Mexican Government denied an offer for intervention to prevent drug trafficking, as well as US President [USA.GetLeader] declaring Mexico as a narco-state in a presidential proclamation, the draft UNSC resolution firmly condemns the ongoing drug crisis and Mexico’s ineffectiveness in stopping it, authorizing a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and placing that Mission under the leadership of the United States to restore the rule of law in Mexico and combat drug trafficking.\n\nWidely seen as an international example of the United States’ ongoing policy of the “War on Drugs,” the Security Council is widely divided on this; with the Soviet delegation and others condemning such blatant messaging but also not indicating any vetoes. Much of the non-Communist Latin American states appear supportive, with the obvious absence of Mexico."
 CIA_LATAMa.28.d:0 "Good news has arrived from our Permanent Representative to the United Nations today, as they have confirmed that the Security Council has approved our draft resolution on the Mexico issue.\n\nUnder consultation from the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the UN resolution stipulates the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, managed under the command of the United States and other participating countries. The resolution also firmly condemned the Mexican government for their ineffectiveness thus far in preventing drug trafficking.\n\nOfficials in Foggy Bottom, the Pentagon, and New York are quickly coordinating to establish a group of participating countries, as well as pre-positioning military assets near the Mexican border to begin the operation once it is formed by the UN."
 CIA_LATAMa.29.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from United Nations Headquarters in New York City, as the United Nations Security Council, acting under the influence and sway of the United States, passed a resolution authorizing the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico.\n\nApparently displeased with our government’s effectiveness thus far in combating the drug crisis, the UN has granted American forces permission to lead the Mission, with international personnel and support from the region and around the world.\n\nMany within the government, including President [MEX.GetLeader] are very displeased, and are urging any and all resistance to UN and American forces. Time will tell what the Mission does, how it operates with this crisis, and how we will respond"
 CIA_LATAMa.30.d:0 "Further surprise from United Nations Headquarters in New York City came as the United Nations Security Council, led by the United States, approved a draft resolution authorizing a UN Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico. Apparently recognizing the need for international drug control and enforcement, all five Permanent Members of the Security Council agreed on the issue, with no vetoes, even from the Soviet Union.\n\nPlacing the United States as primarily in charge of the Mission, it is expected that operations in Mexico will begin shortly. International support, both within the Security Council and in the General Assembly, will be required to receive more volunteers and enforcement personnel. Mexico, while not having officially commented, has had major government officials express extreme disapproval, and it is expected that Mexican government interference in Mission operations will occur on almost all issues."
 CIA_LATAMa.31.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from UN Headquarters in New York today, with our Ambassador to the United Nations calling the White House and informing [USA.GetLeader] that the Security Council resolution regarding Mexico has failed, with a veto by the Soviet Union, effectively ending any meaningful proposals the US had.\n\nState and Defense Department officials are reportedly furious, with members of the UN delegation in New York attempting to gain some traction in the General Assembly for a draft resolution there. However, any chance of a UN monitoring mission in Mexico has failed, due to Eastern Bloc interference and influence."
 CIA_LATAMa.32.d:0 "Good news has arrived from the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations, that a proposed draft resolution in the Security Council forming a UN Monitoring Mission in our country has failed, due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nSenior government officials are reportedly pleased, while diplomatic sources in the United States report that many State Department and White House officials are furious, and may be turning to contingencies to achieve their goals. It is still not known what the United States will do to continue this issue, but we can at least be safe from an international intervention for now."
 CIA_LATAMa.33.d:0 "More news has come from UN Headquarters in New York today as the United Nations Security Council rejected a US-authored resolution to form an international monitoring and enforcement force in Mexico to control the ongoing drug crisis there. According to UN officials, the resolution failed due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nWhile Mexican officials are reported as being relieved by this development, American officials are furious, particularly after they had mounted a campaign of international support for drug enforcement operations. It is not immediately clear if the US will act alone to solve the issue, but only time will tell."
