 MLA_Victory.1:0 "The 'Malayan National Liberation Army' Has Taken Over the Country!"
 MLA_Victory.1_desc:0 "Tragically, despite the British and the Malayan army best attempt at defending Malaya from the MLA, they failed to prevent the Communist from taking over Malaya. With the Communists controlling Malaya, many have fled to escape persecution from the new Communist government. Many officials also hope to set up a Malayan government in exile elsewhere in hope to reclaim Malaya from the Communists one day, while the British have expressed interests in reestablishing the White Rajah to power in Sarawak."
 MLA_Victory.2:0 "The Plan to Establish a Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.2_desc:0 "With the defeat in Malaya to the Communist force, we have decided to help the Malayan setting up a government in exile in the islands not under Communist control. We have also decided to tighten security to ensure that no Communist infiltrators could subverse any attempts at preventing our return to Malaya."
 MLA_Victory.3:0 "Establishment of the Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.3_desc:0 "Recently, we have received news that the British have set up a government in exile for the former Malayan government in Singapore. While this is only a temporary setback to our plan to unify Malaya, we still have time to prepare for our liberation of Singapore. We will now begin our liberation of Singapore by sending infiltrators to contact any Communist cells there to undermine the British garrison."
 MLA_Victory.4:0 "Establishment of the New Domains"
 MLA_Victory.4_desc:0 "After our victory in Singapore, we have received news that the British have set up puppet states in Borneo such as the White Rajah of Sarawak, the Dominion of Borneo and the Kingdom of Brunei. To us, these states are nothing more than the continuation of British colonialism in Southeast Asia. We must continue our liberation of Borneo just as we did in Malaya and Singapore by aiding our comrades in Borneo."
 MLA_Victory.5:0 "The Capture of Gerald Templar & Tunku Abdul Rahman"
 MLA_Victory.5_desc:0 "Great news! We have captured Gerald Templar and Tunku Abdul Rahman, who were responsible for the massacres of our comrades. This is a huge blow to the British considering that they put Templar in charge of the atrocities against our comrades. We will give him the treatment he deserves for killing our comrades."

 MLA_Victory.0:0 "Britain Evacuates to the City of Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.0_desc:0 "With Malaya fallen to the Malayan National Liberation Army, the British began evacuating as many Malayan official and personnel to Singapore. While this is a setback to British control in Malaya, the Malayan government promise to free Malaya from the Communist forces once and for all."
 MLA_Victory.100:0 "The Malayan Government in Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.100_desc:0 "The loss of Malaya and the retreat of the Malayan government to Singapore has been a huge blow to the British and its western allies in Southeast Asia as it spells another domino collapsing on Malaya. Many Malays had also fled their home from Malaya to avoid persecution from the Communist forces and crowded among the City of Singapore. The influx of Malays in Singapore has led to ethnic tension rising between Malays and Chinese residents and only time will tell whether the Communist would take advantage of this chaos."
 MLA_Victory.200:0 "The Raj of Sarawak restored!"
 MLA_Victory.200_desc:0 "With the Federation of Malaya falling to the Communists, Britain has begun restoring the old Raj of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke to his throne in Sarawak in an attempt to stop Borneo from the same fate as Malaya from falling under communism. While the restoration of the Raj of Sarawak is celebrated by Britain, her allies, and the Sarawakian natives as another ally to stop the dominoes from falling, many also criticize the move as continuing an “ Evil “ colonial minority regime in South East Asia. The White Rajah Vyner has declared that the move is temporary and he will collaborate with the Native’s Negri Council to decide a long-term future for the Country. Only time will tell whether the White Rajahs will hold their domain in Sarawak or Sarawak will fall just like Malaya."
