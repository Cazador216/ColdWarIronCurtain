 POLITICS_NOBUSUKE_KISHI_DESC:0 "During the 1920s and early 1930s, the brilliant young bureaucrat Nobusuke Kishi travelled to the leading industrial powers of the world and studied their economic policies. Upon his return he became a believer in state-guided economic growth. By the mid-1930s the Japanese Army handed Manchukuo's economic policy entirely in Kishi's hands. He oversaw economic growth but was involved in corruption and labor exploitation before his return to Japan in 1940. During the war he served several cabinets, mostly as the Munitions Minister. When the war ended he was detained but avoided criminal charges despite his deep involvement with the brutal exploitation of non-Japanese labor. He found the American trials to be illegitimate and sought to organize conservative supporters in Japan to assert the country's independence. Although a member of the ruling Liberal Party, he actively criticizes and undermines Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida for his over-reliance on the United States. However, at the moment Kishi has avoided being purged by the Americans because of his ability to organize conservative factions in the Liberal Party against the Japanese socialists."
 POLITICS_SHIGERU_YOSHIDA_DESC:0 "When the Liberal Party won the 1946 general elections, the Allied authorities quickly barred the party leader, Ichiro Hatoyama from becoming Prime Minister. In his stead Shigeru Yoshida took over the premiership. Shigeru Yoshida joined the foreign service in 1906 and during World War II he actively sought to push Japan to pursue peace with the Allied powers. The career diplomat long had pro-American and pro-British leanings, making him an ideal Prime Minister for the occupying authorities. Since becoming Prime Minister, Yoshida has focused on economics, seeking to rebuild the Japanese economy. In terms of foreign policy, Yoshida has worked to establish a security partnership with the United States. Many suggest this policy prioritizing the economy and differing defense to the Americans as a Yoshida doctrine. Yoshida must keep a lid on the remnants of nationalist factions in Japan and demonstrate to the wider population that his policies will lead to prosperity and security for Japan or risk being labeled an American stooge."
