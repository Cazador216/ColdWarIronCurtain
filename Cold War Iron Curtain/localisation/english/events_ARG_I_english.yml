  If we manage to complete the Three-Year Plan, our colleague Domingo Mercante will secure the province of Buenos Aires for Peronism and we will have greatly improved the quality of life of all the citizens of Buenos Aires. Although there are certain officials of our government who refuse Perón to grant these funds to Domingo Mercante because, according to them, that state money could be reinvested much better in other sectors of the country."

  arg.4.t: "Cult of General Peron"
  arg.4.desc: "The Peronist government officially proclaims the establishment of the cult of personality of Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina. This measure seeks to enhance his figure as a visionary leader and defender of the rights of the Argentine people, consolidating his legacy and strengthening his political power. Perón rises to the category of a national symbol, generating devotion and loyalty among his followers. The cult is used to massively mobilize popular support around his leadership, creating a sense of unity and community among the followers of Peronism. The government strengthens its authority and political legitimacy, strengthening the control of the justicialist party over State institutions. A narrative is promoted that glorifies Perón's achievements, minimizing his mistakes and controversies during his government."
  arg.4.a: "Viva Peron"
  arg.5.t: "The Visca Commission"
  arg.5.desc: "The press opposed to the National and Popular Model of our General is attacking with fallacies, such as that there are opposition politicians tortured and political detainees in the Perón regime. Who could come up with such a fallacy? Due to these accusations without real grounds, our Minister of the Interior, Ángel Borlenghi, recommended us to the Deputy, Journalist and Constitutionalist José Emilio Visca, a Peronist who will launch the Visca Commission, a bicameral parliamentary commission that will have to investigate the complaints of the opposition to prove our innocence. But Visca insists that it must use it to launch a campaign to put an end to the coup-mongering opposition press and traitor to the homeland of National Justicialism, which from provincial or private commercial headlines would be employing a smear campaign to the workers' popular government. Do we use the idea of Visca or do we listen to some of our ministers who recommend us to comply with the main original objectives of the Visca Commission?"
  arg.5.a: "Let's Make the Idea of Visca Real"
  arg.5.b: "Let's Stick to the Initial Objectives"
