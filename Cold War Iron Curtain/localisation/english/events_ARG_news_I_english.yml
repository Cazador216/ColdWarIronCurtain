 news.1600.d:0 "Breaking news are arriving from Argentina of a successful coup d'état against the Peronist government. The coup d'état occurred when members of the Army, Navy and Aeronautics, under the command of retired General Benjamín Menéndez and Eduardo Lonardi, successfully overthrew the government of President Juan Domingo Perón. In their brief proclamation, the rebels accused the government of having led the Nation to "a total bankruptcy of its internal and external credit, both morally and spiritually as well as materially". The restrictions on civil liberties and the actions of political opponents, the constitutional reform that allowed the re-election of the President, as well as the measures to politicise the armed forces seem to have influenced the military adherents to the movement. Despite some disagreements amidst the rebel leadership, the coup was launched during a favourable political moment and was successful, with Peron's current whereabouts being unknown. While the current provisional military dictatorship promised a return to democratic processes, they argue this will only happen when all Peronist influences are removed from all levels of government. It remains to be seen if Argentina will become a democratic nation one day."
