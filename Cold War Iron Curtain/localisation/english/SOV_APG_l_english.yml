 soviet_leader_change.5.t:0 "Emergency meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU"
 soviet_leader_change.5.desc:0 "On June 18, a regular meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee was organized under the pretext of Khrushchev's removal from the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU.\n\nThe "anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Shepilov, who joined them" a group of the most prominent figures of the Stalin era, attempted to remove Khrushchev by recruiting a majority to the Presidium of the majority, which they succeeded in doing.\n\nBut did the agreement between Zhukov and Serov come true, and the "Anti-Party Group" was suspended and denigrated?"
 soviet_leader_change.5.o.A:0 "Khrushchev won, the meeting of the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU"
 soviet_leader_change.5.o.B:0 "Khrushchev is suspended, the victory of the APG"
 
 soviet_leader_change.8.t:0 "Appointment of Vyacheslav Molotov as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU"
 soviet_leader_change.8.d:0 "Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, the head of the Soviet Union, after the success of the Anti-Party Group in 1957, decided to resign due to age and inability, partly inexperience in government. Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and one of the most prominent figures of the Stalin era, will take over his post."
 soviet_leader_change.8.A:0 "Good luck, Vyacheslav Mikhailovich!"
 
 SOV_Molotov.1.t:0 "Final of Central Committee Clean"
 SOV_Molotov.1.desc:0 "\n\nFor the most part, a historical mistake, after the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Khrushchev won the struggle for power. Insane reforms, unnecessary "liberalization", condemnation of the so-called "cult of Stalin's personality", which led to a split in the socialist camp and its associates. But, thanks to a successful combination of events in 57, this error was corrected. Yes, Bulganin's rule was short-lived, but it marked a new era and a return to adequate values in the country, at least observance of the precepts of Marx-Lenin and the withdrawal of the "privatization" of positions in the state by the Khrushchevites. Molotov must understand that Khrushchev has done a lot in 4 years, and it will take a lot of work to turn it all around."
 SOV_Molotov.1.a:0 "Revolutsia idet, socialnaya!"
 
 SOV_Molotov.2.t:0 "Reorganize the presidium"
 SOV_Molotov.2.desc:0 "\n\nThe Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is the place where it all began. In particular, salvation for the country and the coming to power of the group. But if we recall the year 57, 7 out of 11 members of the presidium voted for Khrushchev's removal, and we cannot allow the possible victory of "new conspirators" of any kind."
 SOV_Molotov.2.a:0 "To protect and save"
 
 SOV_Molotov.3.t:0 "Purge of Mikoyan and Podgorny"
 SOV_Molotov.3.desc:0 "\n\nAnastas Hovhannesovich Mikoyan was a prominent Stalinist people's commissar in the past, who betrayed himself first of all for the sake of profit in order to retain his position, and Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny was the first secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee, who aimed at prominent Soviet ranks, in his case traitors to the Motherland and Soviet state, who betrayed both the ideas of communism and the entire Soviet Union should be repressed in order to prevent the spread of their infection"
 SOV_Molotov.3.a:0 "Another Khrushev lapdogs, nothing special"
 
 SOV_Molotov.4.t:0 "Purge of Suslov and Ponomarenko"
 SOV_Molotov.4.desc:0 "\n\nMikhail Andreevich Suslov is a vivid political, and primarily an ideological toy of Khrushchev, in fact, a mouthpiece for promoting revisionist nonsense and a policy of betrayal. Panteleimon Kondratievich Ponomarenko is essentially a nationalist with delusional ideas and megalomania, in particular his desire to transfer Kaliningrad and attempts to become almost secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In order not to promote this horror to the masses, these individuals should be repressed as soon as possible"
 SOV_Molotov.4.a:0 "Common sense always wins"
 
 SOV_Molotov.5.t:0 "Lazar Kaganovich Appointed as a Chairman of Presidium"
 SOV_Molotov.5.desc:0 "\n\nLazar Moiseevich Kaganovich was officially appointed Secretary of the Presidium - the 2nd person of the state. Kaganovich has always been famous for his dedication and ability to bring things to an end - that's why Molotov is confident in him. It is rumored that he will be the next head of state after Molotov - but let's wait and see"
 SOV_Molotov.5.a:0 "Iron Lazar is the best, as always"
