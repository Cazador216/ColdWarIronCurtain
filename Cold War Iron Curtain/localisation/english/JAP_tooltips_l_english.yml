 JAP_National_Radicalism_GUI_info_text:0 "§YInfluence Equilibrium§! represents the tug-of-war between the §Yfar-rightists§! and §Yfar-leftists§!. It has no modifier, but some decisions or even focuses may require a certain amount of influence percentage of any side.\n\n§YUnrest Levels§! represent the severity of activism from both spectrums, just like the name suggests. The more the unrest level increases, the severe the effects of the §YFar-Right Activism§! or §YFar-Left Activism§! National Spirits get.\n\n§YCurrent Issues§! is just a list of causes contributing to the unrest of both radical spectrums. However, the list acts more as flavour or immersiveness, since you cannot manually remove the issues. Certain events, decisions, and national focuses will add or remove the issues over the time.\n\nThroughout the gameplay, you must expect a handful of events and national focuses that will affect the mechanics above in both good or bad way. Be wise of what you do to keep Japan stable!"
