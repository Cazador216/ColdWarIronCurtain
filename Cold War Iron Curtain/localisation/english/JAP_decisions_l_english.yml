 JAP_Keiretsu_Category:0 "Empowering the Keiretsu"
 JAP_Keiretsu_Category_desc:0 "After the war, the American occupation authorities dismantled the powerful zaibatsus, which were large enterprises in our land, in an effort to break their monopolistic control. However, in the present day, we should consider the need to utilise the remnants of these industrial giants. Reviving them as '§YKeiretsus§!' could be a vital step in revitalising post-war Japan, which currently finds itself in a state of economic disarray. These historically influential business conglomerates have the potential to bring stability and economic growth to a nation that is eager to rebuild and regain its former prosperity. By reinvigorating the spirit of cooperation and long-term strategic planning that Keiretsus represent, Japan may find the necessary foundation to address its current challenges and pave the way for a brighter future."

 JAP_National_Radicalism_Category:0 "National Radicalism of Japan"
 JAP_National_Radicalism_GUI_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the War, Japan was beset by the rise of political extremism. Radicals on the left and right challenge the democracy built during the American Occupation. The Japanese Socialist Party is the largest leftist force in the country, though for now it remains overshadowed by the conservatives in politics. The radical right are more dissolute, ranging from neo-imperialist student groups to government men bitter over the fall of the Empire. Japan yearns to follow a stable conservative path but if one side dominates, it could face an unexpected change in political landscape."
