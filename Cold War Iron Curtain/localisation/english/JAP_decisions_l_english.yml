 JAP_Keiretsu_Category_desc:0 "After the war, the American occupation authorities dismantled the powerful zaibatsus, which were large enterprises in our land, in an effort to break their monopolistic control. However, in the present day, we should consider the need to utilise the remnants of these industrial giants. Reviving them as '§YKeiretsus§!' could be a vital step in revitalising post-war Japan, which currently finds itself in a state of economic disarray. These historically influential business conglomerates have the potential to bring stability and economic growth to a nation that is eager to rebuild and regain its former prosperity. By reinvigorating the spirit of cooperation and long-term strategic planning that Keiretsus represent, Japan may find the necessary foundation to address its current challenges and pave the way for a brighter future."

 JAP_National_Radicalism_GUI_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the War, Japan was beset by the rise of political extremism. Radicals on the §Rleft (sayoku)§! and §Bright (uyoku)§! challenge the conservative status-quo built during the American Occupation.\n\nThe §RNihon Shakai-to (JSP)§! is the largest leftist force in the country, leading the socialist camp. However, the party often struggles with the internal divisions, as well as having to compete with the dominance of the conservative camp. Despite that, the socialist camp is very effective in giving immense support to the labour unions as well as the §RZengakuren§!, and use them to trouble the conservative administration. On the other hand the radical right are more dissolute, consisting of various §BUyoku Dantai§! (ultra-nationalist groups). There is also the presence of the §BYakuza§! clans, who often use their wealth and power against the far-leftism movements. While ultra-nationalist parties possess minimal influence in the National Diet compared to their socialist counterparts, the increased prominence of far-rightism could potentially give rise to ultra-nationalist factions within the conservative camp.\n\nJapan yearns to follow a stable conservative status quo, and achieve prosperity. But if one side dominates, it could face a significant change in political landscape."

This led to a decline in nationalist right-wing forces, but soon replaced by pro-American groups. However, amidst the Cold War's peak and the Americans wishing to uphold Japan as an anti-communist ally, right-wing movements were allowed to resurge, countering the growing leftist unrest. Patriot gatherings emerged, birthing a mixture of pre-war and post-war activist groups. These right-wing groups staunchly oppose leftist radicals, endorse American ties, and advocate Japan's rearmament. Notably, the bōryokudan (violent Yakuza groups) often financially support these factions."

Inspired by Mao Zedong's tactics, they have established numerous militant strongholds in rural villages. While their aim of a nationwide revolution is nothing but a farce, their militant activities still disrupt public peace and stability. Utilising Molotov cocktails and other makeshift weaponry, they frequently target police stations and the residences of right-wing politicians. These militants evidently agitate other left-wing radicals toward violence to varying degrees, so they need to be dealt with as soon as possible."
