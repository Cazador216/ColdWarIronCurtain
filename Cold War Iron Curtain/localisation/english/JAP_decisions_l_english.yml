 JAP_National_Radicalism_GUI_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the War, Japan was beset by the rise of political extremism. Radicals on the left and right challenge the democracy built during the American Occupation. The Japanese Socialist Party is the largest leftist force in the country, though for now it remains overshadowed by the conservatives in politics. The radical right are more dissolute, ranging from neo-imperialist student groups to government men bitter over the fall of the Empire. Japan yearns to follow a stable conservative path but if one side dominates, it could face an unexpected change in political landscape."
