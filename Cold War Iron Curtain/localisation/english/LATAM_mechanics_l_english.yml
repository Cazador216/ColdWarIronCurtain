 LATAM_SFC_DESC:0 "The §YStandard Fruit Company§! holds a significant presence in Central America. Established in 1924 by the Vaccaro brothers in New Orleans, the company has played a major role in shaping the region's economic outlook. Its extensive operations in banana plantations and transportation networks have facilitated economic growth and employment opportunities. However, the company's dominance has raised concerns about unequal wealth distribution and dependence on foreign entities. Central American nations grapple with the challenge of balancing their own interests with those of the Standard Fruit Company, which some perceive as a symbol of foreign control. As of 1949, the company continues to exert influence over the region's economy and politics, contributing to a complex relationship with Central America."
 LATAM_UFC_DESC:0 "The §YUnited Fruit Company§! is a controversial presence in Central America. Initially founded in 1899, the company established extensive banana plantations throughout the region, gaining significant wealth and political power. Their control over transportation networks allowed it to dictate terms to local governments and restrict competition from domestic growers. The company's operations are often viewed as exploitative, with allegations of labor abuses, environmental degradation, and unequal wealth distribution. The United Fruit Company's influence is felt throughout Central American society, with many viewing it as a symbol of foreign exploitation. By the onset of the Cold War, the United Fruit Company has established a complex relationship with Latin America, one that remains contentious to this day."
 DOMESTIC_GROWER_DESC:0 "This represents the control that the government, local landowners and domestic corporations control of the nations infrastructure and land as compared to that controlled by the international corporations."
 BELIZE_ESTATE_DESC:0 "The YBelize Estate Company§! holds a significant role in our nation's history from its establishment to the present day. Founded in 1875 in Great Britain, the company has been a driving force in the development of Belize's agriculture, infrastructure and forestry industries. The company's vast plantations and transportation networks have created employment opportunities and contributed to the growth of our economy along with ensuring that the United Fruit Company and Standard Fruit Company were unable to fully expand operations into Belize.  However, concerns have been raised about issues such as labor conditions and fair wealth distribution. Overall, the Belize Estate Company remains a crucial player in our nation's journey towards development and continues to shape the future of Belize. Furthermore, the Belize Estate Company is clearly a colonial instrument established in Britain and represents a threat to the future sovereignty of our nation."
