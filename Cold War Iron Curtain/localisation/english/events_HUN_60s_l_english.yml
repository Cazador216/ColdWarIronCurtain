 HUN_Kadar.1.d:0 "The Hungarian Revolution and its consequences have left long-standing scars in Hungary, not just for its people, but the government as well. Not only does our government need to cope with rising discontent, and a struggling economy, but it must find its footing with an unreceptive population. While we have our work cut out for us, at the same time, we've been given a rare opportunity to completely reshape and overhaul Hungarian society, as well as to save and completely overhaul the socialist system to better fit the needs of the average Hungarian. We are part of the Warsaw Pact's front lines, and we must prove our stability, reliability, and with enough effort, model an economy that can rival that of even Western European states."
 HUN_Kadar.2.d:0 "Imre Nagy was a capitalist wrecker, and a cold-blooded traitor. This much is a fact. However, the leadership of Comrade Kadar is ever pragmatic, and he can recognize that even a traitor may have an idea or two worth looking into. Our allies seem to be quite overzealous in their anti-Western rhetoric. While their commitment to the socialist cause is an admirable trait, we want to make sure the Cold War stays cold.\n\nFurthermore, we don't have any unfounded delusions of grandeur. We know full well we are far behind the West in nearly every aspect but morality. Not to mention if we ever want to be considered a recognized state, we need both the support of their Soviet liberators, as well as the West. At the same time, many within our party categorically oppose this idea; after all, if we push too far, we risk Soviet intervention yet again, not to mention making too many needless concessions will all but destroy our already fragile economy."
 HUN_Kadar.3.d:0 "The VIII Party Congress is perhaps the most crucial event for our party since the end of the dreaded events of 1956. Here, the newest direction of our nation has been definitely decided, as well as just what to do now that we have room to breathe?\n\nComrade Kadar, and by extension, the party, has decided to follow in the footsteps of Comrade Khrushchev in distancing ourselves from our Stalinist path, and embracing necessary reforms; such as general amnesty, market reform, consumerist policies and more. Our party firmly asserts itself as Socialist, but the age of needless authoritarianism is far behind us, and as a party meant to represent, and elevate the proletariat; then we should change to accommodate their needs."
 HUN_Kadar.4.d:0 "Now that the Congress has come and passed, it is time to finally answer the foreign policy question, specifically in relation to two of the largest challenges we currently face: that of our recognition, trade deficit, and overall finances.\n\nThe first option, Comrade Kadar's preferred choice, is to open ourselves up to the Western world. This will move us ever closer to international recognition, open the opportunity to withdraw loans from Western countries to both re-invest as well as keep up with the growing costs that come with our new consumerist policies. That being said, this equallt leaves open a new array of problems, as it will leave our already existing, and necessary, trade with our current allies neglected, and allow them to degrade, hurting both us and our neighbors. Lest we mention we risk the ire of the Soviet Union, and even our party for a second time. Furthermore, while loans will provide a desperately needed lifeline in the short term, our economy is in no shape to pay back any significant loans we take, and risk the creation of yet another crisis.\n\nThe other option is popular among the conservative members of our party, and that is strengthening our economic ties within both COMECON, and the socialist world. This will provide an increased level of cooperation, effectiveness across COMECON, and fill our deficit in due time; as well as help us grow our economy with the long term in mind. This too has its problems, as it provides no solution in regards to international recognition, further isolating us from over half the world; and while providing long-term economic growth and a solution to our trade deficit, gives us no immediate solution to our growing costs, which we are struggling to keep up with as it is.\n\nBoth proposals have their merits, but we can't choose both. It's time to decide."
 HUN_Kadar.5.d:0 "In recent months, our comrades in Budapest have been making a comprehensive effort in greatly expanding the economic infrastructure, as well as connections among our allies in Eastern Europe. That being said, Hungary still faces a slew of their own problems that they are incapable of fully tackling on their own. Hungary's economy is largely reliant on trade, which has been struggling to fully operate due to an ever increasing deficit. Additionally, Hungary is faced by the growing spending of Kadar's government; which some in our party see as Kadar's fault by himself; however we should still consider sending some aid. Ensuring Hungary's economic reliance on Moscow, as well as ensuring the long-term growth of one of our frontline allies with little cost to ourselves, would be a foolish endeavor. Regardless, the party must decide what to do."
 HUN_Kadar.6.d:0 "Despite our unparalleled success, there are a growing number of voices within the party that have grown dissatisfied with Comrade Kadar's leadership. There is a growing volume of whispers, rumors that Kadar's reformism flirts too dangerously with capitalism, accusations that his reforms are far too similar to Nagy to be comfortable. These voices only seem to have grown and intensified after Kadar had begun reshuffling the party apparatus, sidelining once-prominent conservatives. While nothing is certain for now, something dangerous is brewing in the party."
 HUN_Kadar.7.d:0 "As we get a better idea just who is behind the growing dissent in the party, many signs point to former Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku. Once a prominent politician post-1956, often even considered by many to be Kadar's second-in-command, Biszku was demoted, sidelines and hung out to dry after Kadar's policies of general amnesty and his move to appoint reformers had been implemented. Biszku himself, while not against necessary reform, has been a prominent opponent of the capitalist elements of "Goulash Communism" and many in Moscow consider him to be more in line with the Kremlin's doctrine. He hasn't made any noteworty moves against Kadar, and so far has only been a prominent voice of criticism within the party. For now, we can only watch and wait."
 HUN_Kadar.8.d:0 "Director of the KGB Yuri Andropov has recently received an interesting and concerning note from our friends in Budapest. As we continue to move away from Khrushchev's failures, many within Hungary seek to join us. A coalition of Hungarian conservatives, led by the disgraced Bela Biszku, has come to us with a plea to aid them in overthrowing Kadar in order to restore Conservative Socialist rule in Hungary, seeking to bring Hungary back to a planned economy, and rolling back much of Kadar's capitalist reforms.\n\nMany in the party are divided on what to do next. On one hand, the extent of Kadar's reforms, if left unchecked, are quite dangerous, and Hungary is doomed to face further crises if they do not pace themselves.\n\nBiszku himself has on multiple occasions met personally with Comrade Brezhnev, and has many prominent allies within the Hungarian government as it. Furthermore, his policies and justification for our intervention do fit neatly within the Brezhnev Doctrine, coupled with the fact that there are many within the KGB who are eager to follow through with this request.\n\nAt the same time, this could very easily be twisted and viewed as yet another invasion of Hungary; and could, if handled poorly, undo the great strides we've made with Detente, especially after Prague in 1968. Regardless, we need to choose who we think will be better for Hungary, Kadar or Biszku."
 HUN_Kadar.9.d:0 "Shocking news has reached our ears from Moscow, as the revelation of an attempted coup has been revealed to us. A group of party conservatives, centered around Bela Biszku, has reached out to Moscow in secret, hoping to secure aid from the KGB, under the guise of the Brezhnev Doctrine. Many within the KGB had even sided with Biszku; however, a last-minute decision prevented them from taking any action, and Kadar was informed of the pending situation. In the end, it was decided that the KGB would keep leading Biszku on, in order to not build suspicion; while Comrade Kadar quietly would remove Biszku from his remaining positions of power, done to help the situation from reaching public eyes, and to maintain party stability."
 HUN_Kadar.10.d:0 "Soviet forces once again find themselves placed across Hungary in the wake of yet another change in government in the Eastern Bloc. As Janos Kadar's reforms, while popular with the people, ended up making many enemies within the party. Many saw "Goulash Communism" as a direct push towards capitalism, the problem only exacerbating as Kadar attempted to sideline conservatives and remaining hardliners in an attempt to stack the party with reformist elements. Today in Budapest, the once disgraced Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku was inagurated as Kadar's successot, as Janos Kadar was forced to step down and enter retirement, pressued by both the new conservative government and the KGB.\n\nBiszku has already begun purging the party of reformers and announcing plans to do away with Kadar's economic reforms to transition Hungary back to a planned economy. The reaction of the Hungarian population has been one of confusion and anger, as the country once again became enguled in riots and protests. The international community's reaction has been mixed, with outrage and denunciations from the West, and praise and recognition from the East. What the future holds for Biszku's government, only time will tell."
