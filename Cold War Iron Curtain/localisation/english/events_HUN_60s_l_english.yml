 HUN_Kadar.1.d:0 "The Hungarian Revolution and its consequences have left long-standing scars in Hungary, not just for its people, but the government as well. Not only does our government need to cope with rising discontent, and a struggling economy, but it must find its footing with an unreceptive population. While we have our work cut out for us, at the same time, we've been given a rare opportunity to completely reshape and overhaul Hungarian society, as well as to save and completely overhaul the socialist system to better fit the needs of the average Hungarian. We are part of the Warsaw Pact's front lines, and we must prove our stability, reliability, and with enough effort, model an economy that can rival that of even Western European states."
 HUN_Kadar.2.d:0 "Imre Nagy was a capitalist wrecker, and a cold-blooded traitor. This much is a fact. However, the leadership of Comrade Kadar is ever pragmatic, and he can recognize that even a traitor may have an idea or two worth looking into. Our allies seem to be quite overzealous in their anti-Western rhetoric. While their commitment to the socialist cause is an admirable trait, we want to make sure the Cold War stays cold.\n\nFurthermore, we don't have any unfounded delusions of grandeur. We know full well we are far behind the West in nearly every aspect but morality. Not to mention if we ever want to be considered a recognized state, we need both the support of their Soviet liberators, as well as the West. At the same time, many within our party categorically oppose this idea; after all, if we push too far, we risk Soviet intervention yet again, not to mention making too many needless concessions will all but destroy our already fragile economy."
 HUN_Kadar.3.d:0 "The VIII Party Congress is perhaps the most crucial event for our party since the end of the dreaded events of 1956. Here, the newest direction of our nation has been definitely decided, as well as just what to do now that we have room to breathe?\n\nComrade Kadar, and by extension, the party, has decided to follow in the footsteps of Comrade Khrushchev in distancing ourselves from our Stalinist path, and embracing necessary reforms; such as general amnesty, market reform, consumerist policies and more. Our party firmly asserts itself as Socialist, but the age of needless authoritarianism is far behind us, and as a party meant to represent, and elevate the proletariat; then we should change to accommodate their needs."
 HUN_Kadar.4.d:0 "Now that the Congress has come and passed, it is time to finally answer the foreign policy question, specifically in relation to two of the largest challenges we currently face: that of our recognition, trade deficit, and overall finances.\n\nThe first option, Comrade Kadar's preferred choice, is to open ourselves up to the Western world. This will move us ever closer to international recognition, open the opportunity to withdraw loans from Western countries to both re-invest as well as keep up with the growing costs that come with our new consumerist policies. That being said, this equallt leaves open a new array of problems, as it will leave our already existing, and necessary, trade with our current allies neglected, and allow them to degrade, hurting both us and our neighbors. Lest we mention we risk the ire of the Soviet Union, and even our party for a second time. Furthermore, while loans will provide a desperately needed lifeline in the short term, our economy is in no shape to pay back any significant loans we take, and risk the creation of yet another crisis.\n\nThe other option is popular among the conservative members of our party, and that is strengthening our economic ties within both COMECON, and the socialist world. This will provide an increased level of cooperation, effectiveness across COMECON, and fill our deficit in due time; as well as help us grow our economy with the long term in mind. This too has its problems, as it provides no solution in regards to international recognition, further isolating us from over half the world; and while providing long-term economic growth and a solution to our trade deficit, gives us no immediate solution to our growing costs, which we are struggling to keep up with as it is.\n\nBoth proposals have their merits, but we can't choose both. It's time to decide."
 HUN_Kadar.5.d:0 "In recent months, our comrades in Budapest have been making a comprehensive effort in greatly expanding the economic infrastructure, as well as connections among our allies in Eastern Europe. That being said, Hungary still faces a slew of their own problems that they are incapable of fully tackling on their own. Hungary's economy is largely reliant on trade, which has been struggling to fully operate due to an ever increasing deficit. Additionally, Hungary is faced by the growing spending of Kadar's government; which some in our party see as Kadar's fault by himself; however we should still consider sending some aid. Ensuring Hungary's economic reliance on Moscow, as well as ensuring the long-term growth of one of our frontline allies with little cost to ourselves, would be a foolish endeavor. Regardless, the party must decide what to do."
 HUN_Kadar.6.d:0 "Despite our unparalleled success, there are a growing number of voices within the party that have grown dissatisfied with Comrade Kadar's leadership. There is a growing volume of whispers, rumors that Kadar's reformism flirts too dangerously with capitalism, accusations that his reforms are far too similar to Nagy to be comfortable. These voices only seem to have grown and intensified after Kadar had begun reshuffling the party apparatus, sidelining once-prominent conservatives. While nothing is certain for now, something dangerous is brewing in the party."
 HUN_Kadar.7.d:0 "As we get a better idea just who is behind the growing dissent in the party, many signs point to former Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku. Once a prominent politician post-1956, often even considered by many to be Kadar's second-in-command, Biszku was demoted, sidelines and hung out to dry after Kadar's policies of general amnesty and his move to appoint reformers had been implemented. Biszku himself, while not against necessary reform, has been a prominent opponent of the capitalist elements of "Goulash Communism" and many in Moscow consider him to be more in line with the Kremlin's doctrine. He hasn't made any noteworty moves against Kadar, and so far has only been a prominent voice of criticism within the party. For now, we can only watch and wait."
 HUN_Kadar.8.d:0 "Director of the KGB Yuri Andropov has recently received an interesting and concerning note from our friends in Budapest. As we continue to move away from Khrushchev's failures, many within Hungary seek to join us. A coalition of Hungarian conservatives, led by the disgraced Bela Biszku, has come to us with a plea to aid them in overthrowing Kadar in order to restore Conservative Socialist rule in Hungary, seeking to bring Hungary back to a planned economy, and rolling back much of Kadar's capitalist reforms.\n\nMany in the party are divided on what to do next. On one hand, the extent of Kadar's reforms, if left unchecked, are quite dangerous, and Hungary is doomed to face further crises if they do not pace themselves.\n\nBiszku himself has on multiple occasions met personally with Comrade Brezhnev, and has many prominent allies within the Hungarian government as it. Furthermore, his policies and justification for our intervention do fit neatly within the Brezhnev Doctrine, coupled with the fact that there are many within the KGB who are eager to follow through with this request.\n\nAt the same time, this could very easily be twisted and viewed as yet another invasion of Hungary; and could, if handled poorly, undo the great strides we've made with Detente, especially after Prague in 1968. Regardless, we need to choose who we think will be better for Hungary, Kadar or Biszku."
 HUN_Kadar.9.d:0 "Shocking news has reached our ears from Moscow, as the revelation of an attempted coup has been revealed to us. A group of party conservatives, centered around Bela Biszku, has reached out to Moscow in secret, hoping to secure aid from the KGB, under the guise of the Brezhnev Doctrine. Many within the KGB had even sided with Biszku; however, a last-minute decision prevented them from taking any action, and Kadar was informed of the pending situation. In the end, it was decided that the KGB would keep leading Biszku on, in order to not build suspicion; while Comrade Kadar quietly would remove Biszku from his remaining positions of power, done to help the situation from reaching public eyes, and to maintain party stability."
 HUN_Kadar.10.d:0 "Soviet forces once again find themselves placed across Hungary in the wake of yet another change in government in the Eastern Bloc. As Janos Kadar's reforms, while popular with the people, ended up making many enemies within the party. Many saw "Goulash Communism" as a direct push towards capitalism, the problem only exacerbating as Kadar attempted to sideline conservatives and remaining hardliners in an attempt to stack the party with reformist elements. Today in Budapest, the once disgraced Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku was inagurated as Kadar's successot, as Janos Kadar was forced to step down and enter retirement, pressued by both the new conservative government and the KGB.\n\nBiszku has already begun purging the party of reformers and announcing plans to do away with Kadar's economic reforms to transition Hungary back to a planned economy. The reaction of the Hungarian population has been one of confusion and anger, as the country once again became enguled in riots and protests. The international community's reaction has been mixed, with outrage and denunciations from the West, and praise and recognition from the East. What the future holds for Biszku's government, only time will tell."
 HUN_Kadar.11.d:0 "The Hungarian People's Army is far from what we consider a modern fighting force. In an ideal world, Hungary could afford a large-scale reorganization and expansion of our armed forces. However, in all reality, not only can Hungary simply not afford it, we also have no need to. Perhaps one day in the future we can recreate a military that Hungarians can be proud of, but for now, our attention is devoted to our people, and the economy. That being said, this does not mean we can simply ignore our forces. It's time to begin a process of reduction and modernization; by shrinking our armed forces, we can afford better and more modern equipment, and once they've been sufficiently modernized, we can expand it once more."
 HUN_Kadar.12.d:0 "During the reactionary attempt at counter-revolution in 1956, sections of the Hungarian People's Army Air Force sided with the traitors, which led to the Soviets forcefully demilitarizing it for our own safety. While we are grateful that Hungary is no longer under internal threat, we are a country along the Warsaw Pact's front line, and cannot leave our fields outdated and empty any longer. While we cannot fully re-equip and modernize the air force along, given our military industries' shortcomings, it is nonetheless a crucial task that we must undertake, Modernization and expansion of our airfields will also go a long way in repaying our Soviet allies for their aid in 1956, as we can guaranee their pilots ample room in the future of Western European and Balkan operations."
 HUN_Kadar.13.d:0 "As the effects of Goulash Communism and Consumer Socialism radiate throughout Hungarian society, the Hungarian people have taken surprisingly well to these reforms. Many may say that this is intrinsically because of the wrongly perceived "capitalist elements" of our reforms; however, this could not be further from the truth, as the public support for our government is growing at a rate not even we could have possibly predicted.\n\nIf we can only keep steady pace with our reforms and expand the cultural influence of our reforms, we can ensure the longevity of our government, securing socialism without the Soviet Union backing us up."
 HUN_Kadar.14.d:0 "With socialism secured in Hungary, and with ever-changing social norms internationally, the party is left with a pertinent question: what will the role of women and homosexuals have in our People's Republic?\n\nOn one hand, there are many in our party who wish to see their enfranchisement on the grounds of socialist unity, as well as to maintain modern appearances; states such as East Germany even granting homosexuals full legal rights. A fresh wave of public support from these groups would help to maintain popular support of our government and potentially fill our growing industry with an immediate influx of new workers.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many among our population, particularly in rural areas, that still hold staunchly conservative and outdated world views, by our standards. Hasty enfranchisement holds equal risk of upsetting our population even further, as it does with gaining their favor.\n\nWhile we don't need to make an immediate decision, one must be reached eventually, ideally within the decade."
 HUN_Kadar.15.d:0 "The question of female suffrage is a hot topic faced globally; however, it's not as popular here, in our mostly conservative population than it is in countries such as Great Britain or the United States. Nonetheless, while the calls to action may be comparatively quiet, the call is still being heard regardless, and the longer we leave the issue, the worse it will get, and leaving the question unanswered will only hurt public perception of the party in our critical period of reconstruction. That being said, Hungary has two relatively simple choices: either we maintain our nation's stance pre-Soviet liberation, or seek early enfranchisement, comparatively speaking.\n\nOur population is pathetically small compared to the rest of Eastern Europe, and that is not even considering the monumental difference in population sizes with Western European states, where a handful of cities along surpasses the population size of our entire country. If we want long-term growth and ensure that our factories are full of workers, we need to keep women in the traditional role of mothers. Taking this route will also greatly please the more traditionalist elements in the country, especially the few remaining peasants.\n\nHowever, allowing women to hold the same jobs as men, our projections show it will not affect our nation's birth rate to any noticeable degree, and our factories need more workers now, not later, especially if we want to continue to increase the amount of domestically produced commodities. The world is only seemingly growing more progressive in their views on traditional gender roles, and if we choose to maintain our traditionally hardline stance, we won't have only internal stability to worry about, but international pressure from both sides in the Cold War.\n\nWhile we may not have an answer yet, the one thing we can all universally agree on is that we need to decide the course we'll take as soon as possible, preferably now."
 HUN_Kadar.16.d:0 "Hungary has a relatively small population of homosexuals, part of an equally small global population. Many question why we've chosen to take our stance so early, but there are many in the party wishes to avoid the future issues that will inevitably follow if we put the issue off for too long. While confusing to some, establishing the party's position early will give us a clear direction looking forward. Much like the question of female suffrage in Hungary, the question of homosexuality has two simple answers we need to decide between: either maintaining our nation's traditional values, or modernizing to further fit with modern standards and socialist ideals.\n\nRefusing to change anything will likely net no immediate pushback or international attention. We can continue as if there was nothing wrong and see marginal resistance at best. The homosexual population in Hungary will only grow with time, no matter what we do, and as this population grows, nationwide pushback will grow with it.\n\nInversely, the pushback we'll receive from decriminalizing homosexuality will likely fade and die out over time, while keeping it criminalized in the long-term will only have dissent grow in volume the longer we cling to an outdated past. The largest problem maintaining the criminalization of homosexuality is that it contradicts Comrade Kadar's policy of general amnesty, goals of bridging gaps with the general population, and overall leniency and cultural liberalization. At the same time, hastily legalizing homosexuality will only alienate our rural populations even more, even if they are drastically shrinking.\n\nWhile points for and against either argument could be made, and the debate could continue on, we're here to make a decision, not argue."
 HUN_Kadar.17.d:0 "Civil rights activists around the world reacted to news from Budapest today with shock and horror, as the decision to not only maintain but expand Hungary's Homosexuality Database was made earlier today. Created in the 1880s even before the collapse of Austria-Hungary, used throughout the Second World War and even during the reign of Imre Nagy, the Database served as a registry for all recorded homosexuals living within Hungary and was used to justify or intiate mass arrests and imprisonment for identifying homosexuals within the country. Under Janos Kadar's policies of general amnesty and efforts to reform Hungarian culture in a more progressive direction, many expected at the very least a softened stance on the topic, if not the total decriminalization of homosexuality. However, it was recently decided that the Database would be expanded, with reports of many listed within the Database being apprehended by police, bring blackmailed and threatened to reveal names to expand the Database, and increasing the severity of punishments associated with being homosexual. This recent decision has received harsh backlash from both the Soviet Union and the United States, many political observers noting that this will only likely serve to hinder Kadar's attempts to gain Western recognition of his government."
 HUN_Kadar.18.d:0 "Gay rights activists across the world celebrated an important milestone today as news from Budapest indicated that Janos Kadar announced the destruction of Hungary's Homosexuality Database. Created in the 1880s during the period of Austria-Hungary, being used during the Second World War and the time of Nagy, the Database served as a registry of all recorded homosexuals living within Hungary and was used to justify arrests and imprisonment. With Kadar's policies of general amnesty and progessive social policies, many expected a softer stance, but did not expect this decision. With the continued liberalization of Hungarian culture and legal framework, the rather harsh stance many once held to the new regime post-1956 has begun to soften. However, Kadar's harshest critics see the destruction of the Database as a way to hide and cover up other human rights abuses. Regardless, many believe the full legalization of homosexuality in Hungary is in sight!"
 HUN_Kadar.19.d:0 "Magyar Radio Es Televizio, also known as Hungarian Radio and Television (abbreviated as MTV), will serve as our first, and for the time being, largest television and radio broadcasting system in the country, acting as a first crucial step on the long road to modernization. In time, we can organize and centralize television and radio broadcasts from across the Eastern Bloc to be viewed and listened to within Hungary. While this is a luxury for our people and crucial for ensuring both public support and cultural development, it also has more tangible and practical purposes in archiving information and important events."
 HUN_Kadar.20.d:0 "The musical "The Miraculous Mandarin" is a one act pantomime ballet centered around a young girl living in the big city, all out of money, surrounded by a group of tramps. As the night progresses, she lures multiple men into her room, none of which having any money, all until she and the tramps spot a wealthy Mandarin man. As she lures him into her room, she begins to dance seductively; as the Mandarin man's passion rises, he lunges at the woman, causing the tramps to restrian and suffocate him. The Mandarin is stabbed three times with a rusty sword, until being hung from a lamp. The woman tries to tell the men to let the Mandarin go, but the Mandarin dies as they finally embrace.\n\nOriginally banned in Germany in 1926 on moral grounds, it is an older play and far from what many would consider a "safe" play to broadcast. However, the Miraculous Mandarin, no matter how objectionable, has cemented itself into our history as the first fully colored television broadcast."
 HUN_Kadar.21.d:0 "While still relatively new, preserving our national history in all its forms is an ever-important role, and an indispensable tool for future generations. One way to do this is by establishing an archive to store and preserve all of our television and radio programming. Given the crucial role that MTV plays in Hungarian media programming, tasking the creation of an archive to them is a near guaranteed way of preserving our entire broadcast history. MTV already has over 2 million viewers; nearly 3% of our entire population, with an estimated 3 to 5 viewers per television. Many of us may not live to see the benefit of the archives, which will probably not become apparent until the end of this Cold War, but yet one day we will benefit."
 HUN_Kadar.22.d:0 "Reklam Ur, or "Mr. Advertising," is one of the many musical masterpieces produced by our talented artists. A song about the beauty and joys of life, songs like these are symptoms of our success, and stand as proof that our reforms are working. Our people are happy, and can enjoy music like nowhere else in the Warsaw Pact; and as a government, this shoes that we don't have to stoop to intervention to get the results we want. With stability and legitimacy, if we can keep this up, the scars of 1956 will heal with ease, and we can rely on our music to aid us in this effort."
