 HUN_Kadar.1.d:0 "The Hungarian Revolution and its consequences have left long-standing scars in Hungary, not just for its people, but the government as well. Not only does our government need to cope with rising discontent, and a struggling economy, but it must find its footing with an unreceptive population. While we have our work cut out for us, at the same time, we've been given a rare opportunity to completely reshape and overhaul Hungarian society, as well as to save and completely overhaul the socialist system to better fit the needs of the average Hungarian. We are part of the Warsaw Pact's front lines, and we must prove our stability, reliability, and with enough effort, model an economy that can rival that of even Western European states."
 HUN_Kadar.2.d:0 "Imre Nagy was a capitalist wrecker, and a cold-blooded traitor. This much is a fact. However, the leadership of Comrade Kadar is ever pragmatic, and he can recognize that even a traitor may have an idea or two worth looking into. Our allies seem to be quite overzealous in their anti-Western rhetoric. While their commitment to the socialist cause is an admirable trait, we want to make sure the Cold War stays cold.\n\nFurthermore, we don't have any unfounded delusions of grandeur. We know full well we are far behind the West in nearly every aspect but morality. Not to mention if we ever want to be considered a recognized state, we need both the support of their Soviet liberators, as well as the West. At the same time, many within our party categorically oppose this idea; after all, if we push too far, we risk Soviet intervention yet again, not to mention making too many needless concessions will all but destroy our already fragile economy."
 HUN_Kadar.3.d:0 "The VIII Party Congress is perhaps the most crucial event for our party since the end of the dreaded events of 1956. Here, the newest direction of our nation has been definitely decided, as well as just what to do now that we have room to breathe?\n\nComrade Kadar, and by extension, the party, has decided to follow in the footsteps of Comrade Khrushchev in distancing ourselves from our Stalinist path, and embracing necessary reforms; such as general amnesty, market reform, consumerist policies and more. Our party firmly asserts itself as Socialist, but the age of needless authoritarianism is far behind us, and as a party meant to represent, and elevate the proletariat; then we should change to accommodate their needs."
 HUN_Kadar.4.d:0 "Now that the Congress has come and passed, it is time to finally answer the foreign policy question, specifically in relation to two of the largest challenges we currently face: that of our recognition, trade deficit, and overall finances.\n\nThe first option, Comrade Kadar's preferred choice, is to open ourselves up to the Western world. This will move us ever closer to international recognition, open the opportunity to withdraw loans from Western countries to both re-invest as well as keep up with the growing costs that come with our new consumerist policies. That being said, this equallt leaves open a new array of problems, as it will leave our already existing, and necessary, trade with our current allies neglected, and allow them to degrade, hurting both us and our neighbors. Lest we mention we risk the ire of the Soviet Union, and even our party for a second time. Furthermore, while loans will provide a desperately needed lifeline in the short term, our economy is in no shape to pay back any significant loans we take, and risk the creation of yet another crisis.\n\nThe other option is popular among the conservative members of our party, and that is strengthening our economic ties within both COMECON, and the socialist world. This will provide an increased level of cooperation, effectiveness across COMECON, and fill our deficit in due time; as well as help us grow our economy with the long term in mind. This too has its problems, as it provides no solution in regards to international recognition, further isolating us from over half the world; and while providing long-term economic growth and a solution to our trade deficit, gives us no immediate solution to our growing costs, which we are struggling to keep up with as it is.\n\nBoth proposals have their merits, but we can't choose both. It's time to decide."
