In the National Assembly, a hammer sounded to announce the passage of the bill, and the bill became effective as it was. The government made press announcements suggesting the passage of the bill, and as press releases were spread one after another, the national media began to focus on articles related to the passage of the bill. This Bill will certainly have a good effect on our country. Or not."
