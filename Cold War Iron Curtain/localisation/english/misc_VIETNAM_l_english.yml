 #GUI Stuff
 TITLE_TOOLTIP:0 "The power struggles between the major "third forces" in the conflicts Vietnam faces play a major role in shaping what the country will look like moving forward. In pandering or bringing the hammer down on these organizations, criminal entities, and religious cults and institutions, a balance must be maintained - or one organization must come out on top."
 LOYALTY_TT:0 "§YLoyalty Level§!\n\nThe group's alliegance to our government, and their likelyhood that they will help us in our causes."
 ANNIHILATION_TT:0 "§YAnnihilation Progress§!\n\nThe progress in our efforts to destroy the effectiveness and reach of the given group."
 UMDC_TITLE:0 "Unites Mobiles Pour La Defense Des Chretiens (UMDC)"
 UMDC_DESC:0 "Of many of the large Catholic militia groups in the region, the UMDC stands as the most powerful group. Led by Jean Leroy, they have taken control of large swaths of the southern part of the country, taking a toll on resistance movements in the region as well as massacring many non-Christian civilians."
 BINH_XUYEN_TITLE:0 "Binh-Xuyen"
 BINH_XUYEN_DESC:0 "The Binh-Xuyen have proven the most dangerous, insidious, and concerning third force we have had to deal with in this struggle. A rogue military force devoted to wiping out communism, their commanders have resorted to operating like a criminal syndicate; trading opium, operating casinos and extorting the population to fund their private war. While they could be a powerful ally, they are\nfor now a dangerous threat to peace."
 CAO_DAI_TITLE:0 "Cao Dai"
 CAO_DAI_DESC:0 "The Dai-Dao Tam-Ky Pho-Do (The Great Way of Third Universal Redemption) is a new syncretic religion formed in 1926 that has rapidly become a large part of Vietnamese culture over the past few years. Followers preach a syncretized monotheistic belief system that combines local folk culture, Buddhism, Taoism, Daoism and Roman Catholicism with a policy of nonviolence and \nvegetarianism."
 HOA_HAO_TITLE:0 "Hoa Hao Buddhism"
 HOA_HAO_DESC:0 "Despite their origins as a local Buddhist sect worshipping a self-proclaimed "Buddha," Huynh-phu-So syncretized elements of Confucian doctrine and Vietnamese folk practices, the Hoa Hao have transformed into a violent militant group occupying most of the southern provinces, being loyal to no government, Saigon or Hanoi. Keeping them in line is perhaps just as difficult as \ngaining their acceptance."
 HARMONISM_TITLE:0 "Hoa-dong Ton-giao (Harmonism)"
 HARMONISM_DESC:0 "Perhaps the most curious group in the power struggle is that of Thich-hoa-Binh's (Ong Dao-dua) "Coconut" religion, a growing niche following that subscribes to a great deal of synthesized religions, including Christianity and Buddhism. A political figure who has used his group's actions to protest the war, despite the bizarre nature of the group, we are inclined to treat him as a figure \nof status and importance."
 TRINH_MINH_THE_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Trinh-minh-The"
 TRINH_MINH_THE_DESC:0 "Trained by the Japanese and serving as a career soldier, The is perhaps the face of the Cao-Dai movement. Seen as possibly a rival to the government in Saigon, he has been instrumental in the struggle against colonial French efforts. He is equal parts competent and dangerous.\n\nBase of Operations: Tay Ninh"
 LE_VAN_VIEN_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Le-van-Vien"
 LE_VAN_VIEN_DESC:0 "Major General Le-van-Vien has had an extensive and incredible career, from revolutionary in the Viet Minh to collaborator to leader of the Binh Xuyen, engaging in racketeering and corruption scheme under the guise of "police functions for the government".\n\nBase of Operations: Long An"
 JEAN_LEROY_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Jean Leroy"
 JEAN_LEROY_DESC:0 "A brutal man, Leroy has led the UMDC and many of his Catholic forces to political violence against both the government and the other revolutionary parties. He has a deep hatred for many progressive things, and is seen as a butcher and a murderer in his crusade to protect religious communities in his own Fiefdom, something that has made him a target in the communities.\n\nBase of Operations: Kien Hoa"
 TRAN_VAN_SOAI_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Tran-van-Soai"
 TRAN_VAN_SOAI_DESC:0 "Commander-in-chief of the Hoa Hao, Tran Van Soai has enjoyed a career similar to that of Ho Chi Minh, holding down several jobs before converting and becoming a military presence during the Second World War. His methods are brutal, but his message and battle tactics make him a deadly presence in the region.\n\nBase of Operations: Ba Xuyen"
 BA_CUT_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Ba-Cut"
 BA_CUT_DESC:0 "Erratic and cruel, Ba-Cut has become an effective commander in the field in the region, but his brutality against civilians has become a constant annoyance for the government in Saigon. Some in the government question whether his efforts against the communists truly outweigh the bloodshed in his wake.\n\nBase of Operations: An Giang"
 NGUYEN_GIAC_NGO_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Nguyen-giac-Ngo"
 NGUYEN_GIAC_NGO_DESC:0 "A law enforcer and an ardent preacher, Nguyen-giac-Ngo has become one of the most notable military leaders in the Hoa Hao movement. Unlike his contemporaries, he has been more pragmatic, cooperative with the government, and may be a powerful and useful ally.\n\nBase of Operations: Sa Dec"
 LAM_THANH_NGUYEN_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Lam-thanh-Nguyen"
 LAM_THANH_NGUYEN_DESC:0 "Educated in war by the French, Lam Thanh Nguyen has become a threat to communist efforts in the region, but he has been better known as a healer in the sect, and has become something of an alternate figurehead for the movement.\n\nBase of Operations: Chau Doc"
 TRAN_QUANG_VINH_TITLE:0 "Warlord Dossier: Tran-quang-Vinh"
 TRAN_QUANG_VINH_DESC:0 "A former warlord for the Cao-dai movement and a Cuong-de’s collaborator, Tran-quang-Vinh has proved a valued ally and a strong commander, seen as less of a threat as opposed to his figurehead leader. He has links to the Japanese, and has suffered in popularity as a result.\n\nBase of Operations: Tay Ninh"
