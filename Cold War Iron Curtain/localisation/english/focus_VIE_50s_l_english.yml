 PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet’s Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People’s Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang’s forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
 PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang’s forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
 PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China’s Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
 PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
 PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
 PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this “Republic” seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
 PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
 PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
 PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

 VIE_Recommision_WW_Native_Veterns_desc:0 "Our combat effectiveness only goes as far as our general staff. In order to win the war, we will have to enlist the help of veteran leaders who have fought in the greatest wars of our generation. Their services will ensure our victory in any struggle."
 VIE_Recall_French_ProFrench_Native_Officers_desc:0 "To beat a new enemy, we must make deals with old friends. The French forces and their allies that have been expelled from the country must return, in order to turn the tide against any of our foes."
 VIE_Organize_VoBi_Mil_Academies_desc:0 "Our military tradition is one born in the heat of our conflicts with our oppressors. As such, we have access to some of the best teachers of war in the country, and we can use them to train our next generation of heroes and commanders."

This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea. Equipped with modern vessels, patrol boats, and coastal defense assets courtesy of French support, it is our goal to become a renowned force in the turbulent waters of Southeast Asia."
 VIE_Section_Air_desc:0 "Vietnam’s conflicts have been primarily decided by the power of the air, and we have had issues in the past. Designing and producing our own air power will be difficult, but we can start the process of producing a deadly and formidable air force."

 VIE_Expand_PhiTruong_QuanSu_NhaTrang_desc:0 "While many former French and British airfields are in our grasp, we must also build our own, and the Nha Trang Valley is the perfect place to launch and coordinate missions."
 VIE_Recruit_TieuDoan_NhayDu_desc:0 "The use of Paratrooper divisions in war has become a staple, and with our new air capabilities, we must explore the possibilities in making it a critical part of the way we wage war in the Central Highlands."
 VIE_Coordinate_with_CEFEO_desc:0 "In order for us to continue to control the countryside, we must look to other foreign options. We can look to the CEFEO to provide us with foreign legions to bolster our forces."
 VIE_Request_Control_over_French_KhinhQuan_desc:0 "The forces under the control of the French must be used for our benefit. We need all the forces we can acquire in this struggle."

 VIE_Accept_American_Mil_Aid_desc:0 "The Americans, like the French, have supported our efforts, but now we must acquire more aid.

 VIE_Modernize_Autonomous_Armies_Orgs_desc:0 "With the advancement of our own military strength, it would make sense to consider doing the same with our warlord allies. Providing them with arms and equipment to keep them up to date will help us fight our enemies."

Understanding how to control the battlefield at large, from the hamlets to the jungle floors, will be crucial in the way that we will win conflicts in our homeland, and it will cost a country everything to dare attack us."
 VIE_Section_Air_Irregular_desc:0 "The French Planes in service here were very successful at their operations, and we must acquire them to train our future pilots. We must also get advisors to help us train the new generation of air commanders."

 VIE_Auction_off_Imperial_Treasures_desc:0 "The riches of a bygone era can still serve a use for us. The royal treasures that have served the Emperors of the past may still garner a high price on the international market, and that money can be used to infuse our burgeoning national industry."
 VIE_Limited_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "Cautious expansion is the key to steady growth, and in a country that relies on less-than-stable cash flow, we must limit how fast we grow. That will mean a steady hand at the helm and new opportunities to come as they are naturally."
 VIE_Form_3_Ministries_desc:0 "In order to keep growing, we must look to acquire funding from all possible sources. This could mean taking on loans from French banks in order to expand businesses and operate new sources of income for our country."
 VIE_Invite_French_Investors_desc:0 "The French businesses that pulled out of our country due to the unrest in the streets hurt our economy badly, but with control reestablished, we can invite them back. Their help will ensure that our industry continues to grow."

 VIE_TongTruong_CanhNong_desc:0 "Though Saigon is a hotbed for light and heavy industry of all types, it is still a city surrounded by farmland, and we can use it to our advantage. Commercial farming must be an important part of our slow march to economic prosperity, and the land in Saigon would be a key part of our commitment."
 VIE_TongTruong_CongChanh_GiaoThong_desc:0 "Though the railways have been hit very hard, the roads fair little better. Many are still dirt roads, apart from the main highways.

 VIE_SmallScale_Agri_Reforms_desc:0 "The way of life in the Central Highlands and for much of the country is the farming community. Improving their crop yields will also mean a steady hand, as pushing too hard too fast may destroy the farmers and their families, and we need to pursue growth with caution."
 VIE_Widen_Thienly_Highway_Roads_desc:0 "The Central Highways of the country have long been the most reliable source for trucks, cars, and bikes. It serves the country well, and it should be improved and widened, so that we can move more material and industry through it."

 VIE_Protect_French_Plantation_Owners_desc:0 "The French plantations of old, having long been stocked and worked by Vietnamese farmers, young children and old men, must now serve us.

 VIE_Repair_SaigonMytho_Railway_desc:0 "The Saigon-Mytho Rail line is quickly becoming an important - and antiquated - way for industry to move the fruits of our labor. Our government has recognized that we should devote some capital to improving or expanding the rail lines to better serve us."

Our young nation recognized internationally as the State of Vietnam shall be granted greater independence from France within the multi continental system of the French Union, a momentous accomplishment that was the culmination of months of hard work by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai. The Elysee Accords will now move to the French National Assembly, to be officially ratified and signed by the French president.\n\nThe accords stated that Vietnam could now conduct its own foreign affairs, control its finances and have an army. Specifically, we were granted the right to appoint diplomats to China, Thailand, and the Vatican City, but the remainder of our foreign policy will remain under French guidance. Some may decry this as falling short of granting complete independence, but the matter of fact is that this was the best we could have got, especially in such turbulent times where pushing our French benefactors away would be complete suicide. "
 CuongDe.1.d:0 "Gia-Long, first Emperor of the Nguyen dynasty, experienced the devastating tragedy of outliving his own eldest son, Prince Nguyen-Phuc-Canh, who did leave behind a son prior to his death. Despite that, the throne was passed to Gia-Long’s fourth son, Minh-Mang, ancestor of our current Head-of-State Bao-Dai. But the past has come back to haunt us once more, for Cuong-De, descendant of Prince Canh, has become quite a thorn in our side by utilizing his heritage to further his personal political goals.\n\nEducated in Japan, Cuong-De was a key figure in the Dong Du (On the Way to the East) movement, which sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. Facing much persecution from the French, he still nonetheless evaded capture and found the Viet-Nam Quang-Phuc Hoi (Vietnam Restoration Organisation) alongside Phan-Boi-Chau in 1911, hoping to overthrow French colonial rule in Vietnam and establish a democratic republic. The organization failed to gain momentum, crippled by arrests of its members. Cuong-De did not give up, however, and later created the Viet-Nam Phuc-quoc Dong-minh Hoi (League for the Restoration of Vietnam) in 1938 and attempted to court Japanese support.\n\nNow that order has been restored to our country and the French has returned, Cuong-De’s ambitions can not be left unchecked any longer. Having given a public press conference declaring his intent to return to Vietnam and form an opposition to our government, we must make sure that this illegitimate upstart does not gain any further influence. Proposals personally drafted by Bao-Dai will be sent to major foreign powers like France and the United States requesting that they ignore Cuong-De, while a diplomatic protest will be issued to Japan for hosting him as a citizen."

 VeBinh_Militias.1.d:0 "In the middle of the night, several French high colonial command staff enter a utilitarian building that stands amidst lush, tropical vegetation, and the building's exterior shows signs of wear from the humid climate and occasional rain. Inside, the meeting room where the officers and Vietnamese staff members are gathered exudes an atmosphere of seriousness and tension. The room is adorned with functional furniture, such as a long wooden table and simple chairs. The walls are adorned with maps of the region and photographs of key military figures, one of them specifically being Phan-van-Giao’s.\n\nThe atmosphere is palpably tense as the officers and staff members grapple with the urgent and rising threat of the nationalistic militia group known as the Bao Dai. A relatively mature formation of paramilitaries who had fought both for and against the Japanese oppression, but most importantly, they fought the French on every step they took. The Vietnamese staff discuss the matter with hushed voices, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The weight of responsibility and the potential consequences of their decisions hang heavy in the air, giving the room an almost suffocating feeling. Finally, the voice of a French officer broke the tense silence with a concerned tone: "We can't ignore the threat posed by this nationalistic, monarchist, militia group. They are well-armed and well-trained, and their return is certainly alarming."\n\nOutside the building, the sounds of the bustling military camp can be heard, with soldiers training, vehicles moving, and orders being barked together with the occasional dog bark. After one of those said dogs bark, a second French Officer continues with a well-put-out tone, "Agreed, their history of fighting against us makes their integration into the Vietnamese army a delicate decision as well as a difficult state of cooperation between our forces and theirs."\n\nThe humid air carries a mix of aromas, including the scent of sweat, foliage, and the faint smell of gunpowder from recent drills fills the nostrils of the high echelons of people present at this meeting. A complicated environment for complicated people and this was reflected by the following response by a Vietnamese commander, "But if we don't integrate them, they could become a destabilizing force, and arresting them might just escalate the situation further. Yet at the same time, integrating them could provide valuable insights into their motives and future actions."\n\nLowering his voice, he leans into the ear of the Vietnamese Chief of Staff so that the French would not pry on this rather sensible topic, "Remember, they are our people and they fought for our independence, regardless of our different views. There might be common ground for reconciliation." Finally, the Vietnamese army commander lifts his head and looks at the ever-suspicious French generals and comments with a calculated tone. "We must assess the risks and benefits." The French all give each other a look before one of the officers decisively comments "We should." Yet they have not come to any decision as of now. For? They have locked their eyes at the Vietnamese Chief of Staff who has been silent all this time. Waiting for his input, the tension density in the air grows to an almost palpable degree, but just before it has reached the boiling point, he spoke,"
