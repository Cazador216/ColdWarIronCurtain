 PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet's Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang's forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
 PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang's forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
 PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China's Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
 PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
 PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
 PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this “Republic” seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
 PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
 PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
 PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

 VIE_Repair_DaLatThapCham_Railway_desc:0 "The Da Lat-Tham Cham Railway is one of the few railway arteries at our disposal in the south, and it requires constant upkeep in its current state. With new investments and technological improvements, it can be another vital vein in the body of the industrial base."
 VIE_Protect_French_Plantation_Owners_desc:0 "The French plantations of old, having long been stocked and worked by Vietnamese farmers, young children and old men, must now serve us. Though many wish to have the land split up for use by smaller farmers and more families, we must protect the holdings, for they are an important industrial supplier of food."
 VIE_Electrify_Rural_Nam_Phan_desc:0 "The rural regions of Nam-phan have always been backwards and outdated for centuries and largely still are. Thus electrification would be the foundation for further Industrialization and investments in the Region."
 VIE_Repair_SaigonMytho_Railway_desc:0 "The Saigon-Mytho Rail line is quickly becoming an important - and antiquated - way for industry to move the fruits of our labor. Our government has recognized that we should devote some capital to improving or expanding the rail lines to better serve us."

 VIE_Demand_Japanese_Deport_CuongDe_desc:0 "It is disturbing enough to know of the efforts of Cuong-De to undermine our government, but it is insulting to know that the Japanese government refused to repudiate his attempts. Utilizing political pressure, we must demand that he be deported back to Vietnam, to answer for himself."
 VIE_Negotiate_Brevet_Lines_desc:0 "The Brevet Lines, the nautical borders that separate Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese claims, have been a point of contention. The Kuomintang has made moves to suggest that they believe they are the rightful owners of Vietnamese islands in the South. This requires us to negotiate with the Cambodians to clarify the border situation."
 VIE_Demand_PhuQuoc_Ownership_desc:0 "The Nationalist Chinese have gone too far, first in posturing that the island of Phu-Quoc is theirs, and now we have seen armed military personnel moving in positions on and nearby the islands. This is far too much for our government to stand by and accept. We must make strong statements to dispel the illusions that the Kuomintang suffer from."
 VIE_PhuQuoc_Launch_Invasion_desc:0 "The time for politics is past. The Kuomintang have ignored all warnings. Our military is prepared to launch a full invasion of the island to take back what is ours. We will not be denied the property we own."
 VIE_Focus_on_Other_Matters_desc:0 "Military action against KMT incursions in the Phu Quoc region is not the major concern, other matters must take more of our time and effort. We will concern ourselves with the border question when we come to it."
 VIE_Regarding_French_Drawn_Borders_desc:0 "In our continuing border disputes with the Nationalist Chinese, we will have to rely and possibly rework the classical borders written by our original colonial overlords. While fair and solid for a long time, now we must rework them and ensure that these pitiful squabbles end."
 VIE_Accept_DeFacto_TranNinh_desc:0 "In an effort to bring peace, we have elected to agree to the borders that the French have drawn up. While we do not feel it punishes the KMT for their efforts against us on our borders, those borders, properly enforced, will work."
 VIE_Claim_TranNinh_desc:0 "With the question of our borders up in the air, we must take the opportunity to claim the region of Tran Ninh, full of villagers and people who identify as Vietnamese, and are more closely connected to us than the Laotians."
 VIE_Pau_Treaty_desc:0 "Our diplomats with the French have committed to finding a breakthrough in negotiating our financial independence, and we have found that our French counterparts are sympathetic to the cause. We will work to ensure that Vietnamese financial freedom is in our hands above all else."
 VIE_Sign_Autonomous_Forex_Agreement_desc:0 "With our agreement with the French, we have on our plate the ability to sign an agreement that will allow us to open the trading and exchanging of currency. Another step in our financial freedom is secured, and Vietnam can finally begin to pull away from our colonial roots."
 VIE_Accept_Foreign_Affairs_Administrative_Duties_desc:0 "We have prepared ourselves well for the prospect of managing our own affairs and the affairs of state elsewhere in the world, and it is time for us to step into the shoes of foreign and internal policymaking. Ensuring our resources and political bounds permit us to do so, we shall begin to carve our own path."
 VIE_Matignon_Treaty_desc:0 "The French have decided to wash their hands completely of Vietnam, and are ready and willing to sign a treaty announcing their total withdrawal from the region. At last, our independence is being assured by the government, and a conference in Matignon will formalize Vietnam's total independence. Freedom has been achieved!"
 VIE_Beg_Crown_Domain_French_Renouncement_desc:0 "Our French allies have inadvertently caused a political headache for us by not outright denouncing or renouncing the hold the crown has on the people up to this point. While France does not see the harm in this, they are in fact creating resistance to our government in areas where royalist beliefs are strong."
 VIE_Korean_Intervention_desc:0 "Our efforts to supply the Korean soldiers in their effort against the communists are not enough. Our national defense administration has committed themselves to preparing an expeditionary force to help solidify the defense of liberty against the Chinese and their North Korean puppets."
 VIE_Accept_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. It is a proposal we cannot turn away from, our goals are aligned and our duty to the world is on full display."
 VIE_Ignore_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. Though interesting, it is not within the goals of our nation to cooperate currently with foreign bodies. Indeed, their interference would only damage our ability to run the war as we see fit."
 VIE_Attract_US_Support_Long_desc:0 "In our effort against our enemies, our greatest ally is the American government. Steadfast maintenance of our government must now involve full cooperation, and the great resources of the United States will give us the edge we need."

 VIE_A_Change_in_Course_desc:0 "In order to improve inwards, we must look outwards to our close Asian brothers and see how they have managed their affairs. We must move on from the influences of French affairs in our decisions, and chart our own path."
 VIE_Look_up_to_Japan_desc:0 "The affairs of the Japanese in developing a stable post-war government and their way of government have influenced our way of thinking. It is time for us to consider following their lead more closely, in order to ensure continued success."

 VIE_Accept_Geneva_Treaty_desc:0 "Our dastardly cruel enemies to the North have fought us to a bitter standstill, and our political allies have us in a corner, saying that we should accept the terms being presented in Geneva that would split our country in two. While we hate this idea with our fullest minds, we cannot deny the war has progressed in a way we cannot guarantee our success. We must bite the bullet and accept the terms."
 
 VIE_Amalgamatize_VeBinh_Paramilitaries_desc:0 "In order for us to win the conflict, we will need to recruit the paramilitary sects that have, until recently, not been interested in taking a side. Their efforts will help to bring stability and legitimacy to our regime."
 VIE_Recommision_WW_Native_Veterns_desc:0 "Our combat effectiveness only goes as far as our general staff. In order to win the war, we will have to enlist the help of veteran leaders who have fought in the greatest wars of our generation. Their services will ensure our victory in any struggle."
 VIE_Recall_French_ProFrench_Native_Officers_desc:0 "To beat a new enemy, we must make deals with old friends. The French forces and their allies that have been expelled from the country must return, in order to turn the tide against any of our foes."

 VIE_Incorporate_Religious_Sects_BinhXuyen_Forces_desc:0 "In order to gain legitimacy in the South, we most cooperate with entities not totally sympathetic to our cause. The religious sects in the Mekong Delta and the Binh-Xuyen crime syndicate have been a thorn in our side for years, but if we can “convince” them to work with us, we will have gained a powerful ally."

 VIE_Rescue_PhatDiem_Catholic_Militias_desc:0 "The Catholic Militias in and around the city of Saigon have run into trouble dealing with forces in the area.

 VIE_Contact_DaiViet_War_Bases_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the Dai-Viet Party and their paramilitaries including the Hung-Viet and Viet-Sinh Doan are organizing and expanding themselves in the following bases: Nguyen-Hue and Chau-Doc. It is our utmost concern to quickly seize their assets and bases for our national protection effort."
 VIE_Organize_Recon_Armored_Battalions_desc:0 "Investing in better and deadlier armaments is paramount in this struggle. We must find a way to bring in heavier equipment ot arm our recon units."
 VIE_Section_Marine_desc:0 "With its long coastline and numerous maritime trade routes, our young nation is in dire need of a dedicated navy to protect its territorial waters and vital sea lanes. This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea. Equipped with modern vessels, patrol boats, and coastal defense assets courtesy of French support, it is our goal to become a renowned force in the turbulent waters of Southeast Asia."

The infusion of new American weapons, and the use of American manufacturing power to produce more equipment for us will be a crucial step in our ability to conduct operations."
 VIE_Implement_Trad_Tactics_desc:0 "The tactics of old often are not the tactics of the present, but the French do not understand the field of play. We have been fighting in this place since the dawn of time, and we know the land and the way the land plays into our hand better than anyone, and we will use that to destroy our enemies."
 VIE_Encourage_Homemade_Arms_desc:0 "This war is one made from the seeds of convenience, and the people have been forced to become creative with their abilities to defend their homes. We must encourage these actions in order to slow the progress of our enemy in the countryside."
 VIE_Expand_Territoire_Autonome_Battalions_desc:0 "The best bet for security in the countryside is to bolster the strength of our forces. In the Native Lands, many militias and warlord forces can be recruited to our cause. Their support will lead us to victory in the countryside."

 Elysee_Accords.1.d:0 "At the Elysee Palace in the distant land of France, a historic agreement has been reached that will forever change the future of the millions of citizens within our territory. Our young nation recognized internationally as the State of Vietnam shall be granted greater independence from France within the multi continental system of the French Union, a momentous accomplishment that was the culmination of months of hard work by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai. The Elysee Accords will now move to the French National Assembly, to be officially ratified and signed by the French president.\n\nThe accords stated that Vietnam could now conduct its own foreign affairs, control its finances and have an army. Specifically, we were granted the right to appoint diplomats to China, Thailand, and the Vatican City, but the remainder of our foreign policy will remain under French guidance. Some may decry this as falling short of granting complete independence, but the matter of fact is that this was the best we could have got, especially in such turbulent times where pushing our French benefactors away would be complete suicide."
 CuongDe.1.d:0 "Gia-Long, first Emperor of the Nguyen dynasty, experienced the devastating tragedy of outliving his own eldest son, Prince Nguyen-Phuc-Canh, who did leave behind a son prior to his death. Despite that, the throne was passed to Gia-Long's fourth son, Minh-Mang, ancestor of our current Head-of-State Bao-Dai. But the past has come back to haunt us once more, for Cuong-De, descendant of Prince Canh, has become quite a thorn in our side by utilizing his heritage to further his personal political goals.\n\nEducated in Japan, Cuong-De was a key figure in the Dong Du (On the Way to the East) movement, which sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. Facing much persecution from the French, he still nonetheless evaded capture and found the Viet-Nam Quang-Phuc Hoi (Vietnam Restoration Organisation) alongside Phan-Boi-Chau in 1911, hoping to overthrow French colonial rule in Vietnam and establish a democratic republic. The organization failed to gain momentum, crippled by arrests of its members. Cuong-De did not give up, however, and later created the Viet-Nam Phuc-quoc Dong-minh Hoi (League for the Restoration of Vietnam) in 1938 and attempted to court Japanese support.\n\nNow that order has been restored to our country and the French has returned, Cuong-De's ambitions can not be left unchecked any longer. Having given a public press conference declaring his intent to return to Vietnam and form an opposition to our government, we must make sure that this illegitimate upstart does not gain any further influence. Proposals personally drafted by Bao-Dai will be sent to major foreign powers like France and the United States requesting that they ignore Cuong-De, while a diplomatic protest will be issued to Japan for hosting him as a citizen."

 CCC_Unification_Choices.1.d:0 "Earlier today, our Head-of-State Bao-Dai landed in Saigon after a short flight from Đà-Lạt. His arrival there signified a major step towards our reunification efforts with Cochinchina, for the former emperor was personally leading negotiations while also enjoying considerable French backing. The recent passing of a bill declaring Cochinchina to no longer be a direct French territory but instead part of the State of Vietnam in the French Assembly was a significant milestone that allowed our Head-of-State a comfortable position to leverage. With that in mind, Bao-Dai guided the subsequent negotiations…"

Riots and unrest have enveloped our streets, as citizens flock downtown to protest what they deemed to be governmental incompetence. This is undoubtedly a major strike to our legitimacy, and it will take a long time to rebuild our image."

 VIE_Sect_Militias.1.d:0 "In the middle of the night, several French high colonial command staff enter a utilitarian building that stands amidst lush, tropical vegetation, and the building's exterior shows signs of wear from the humid climate and occasional rain. Inside, the meeting room where the officers and Vietnamese staff members are gathered exudes an atmosphere of seriousness and tension. The room is adorned with functional furniture, such as a long wooden table and simple chairs. The walls are adorned with maps of the region and photographs of key military figures, one of them specifically being Phan-van-Giao's.\n\nThe atmosphere is palpably tense as the officers and staff members grapple with the urgent and rising threat of the nationalistic militia group known as the Bao Dai. A relatively mature formation of paramilitaries who had fought both for and against the Japanese oppression, but most importantly, they fought the French on every step they took. The Vietnamese staff discuss the matter with hushed voices, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The weight of responsibility and the potential consequences of their decisions hang heavy in the air, giving the room an almost suffocating feeling. Finally, the voice of a French officer broke the tense silence with a concerned tone: "We can't ignore the threat posed by this nationalistic, monarchist, militia group. They are well-armed and well-trained, and their return is certainly alarming."\n\nOutside the building, the sounds of the bustling military camp can be heard, with soldiers training, vehicles moving, and orders being barked together with the occasional dog bark. After one of those said dogs bark, a second French Officer continues with a well-put-out tone, "Agreed, their history of fighting against us makes their integration into the Vietnamese army a delicate decision as well as a difficult state of cooperation between our forces and theirs."\n\nThe humid air carries a mix of aromas, including the scent of sweat, foliage, and the faint smell of gunpowder from recent drills fills the nostrils of the high echelons of people present at this meeting. A complicated environment for complicated people and this was reflected by the following response by a Vietnamese commander, "But if we don't integrate them, they could become a destabilizing force, and arresting them might just escalate the situation further. Yet at the same time, integrating them could provide valuable insights into their motives and future actions."\n\nLowering his voice, he leans into the ear of the Vietnamese Chief of Staff so that the French would not pry on this rather sensible topic, "Remember, they are our people and they fought for our independence, regardless of our different views.
