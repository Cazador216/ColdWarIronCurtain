 PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet’s Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People’s Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang’s forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
 PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang’s forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
 PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China’s Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
 PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
 PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
 PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this “Republic” seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
 PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
 PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
 PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

 VIE_Amalgamatize_VeBinh_Paramilitaries_desc:0 "After the surrender of Japan resulted in the end of the Second World War, many individuals in our country utilized the subsequent power vacuum to take up arms and fight .Such struggles vary a lot in terms of their goals, ranging from noble attempts at independence and self-determination to mere self-preservation and opportunistic pillaging among the chaos. The matter of fact is that there are now hundreds of paramilitaries with different allegiances all over our lands, and something must be done about them.\n\nWhile some may cite instability to call for their total disbandment, we simply do not have the resources to undertake such a huge task. A much more suitable course of action would be to put a leash on these groups and try to integrate them into our young National Army. With enough training and supervision, surely even the most ragtag of paramilitaries can become an elite force loyal to Bao-Dai’s cause."
 VIE_Recommision_WW_Native_Veterns_desc:0 "Throughout the country, there are many native citizens who witnessed frontline action in the recent Second World War, and a few that were there in the trenches of the Great War even. Their first hand experience of such large-scale and intense warfare could prove to be immensely valuable to the development of our infant National Army. Attempts to commision these individuals as military officers to oversee training must be made as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, we must come to terms with the very likely outcome that most of these invites will not yield anything successful. The majority of their recipients are either too old or ill for service, and our Francophile Head-of-State Bao-Dai much prefers French-trained or outright French officers anyway."
 VIE_Recall_French_ProFrench_Native_Officers_desc:0 "With the end of World War II, the French Army has emerged victorious in a global conflict for the second time in history. Such an accomplishment once again demonstrates their military prowess, a capability that has been apparent ever since the conquest of the great Napoleon.\n\nIt would be foolish of us to even think about turning away such a colossal power in pursuit of something as abstract as independence when we could be learning so much from them. Starting from today, the bulk of our fledgling National Army shall be made up of French or French-trained generals and officers. Competent men such as Tran-Van-Xuân, Nguyen-Van-Hinh, etc. shall lead our armed force into a new era of triumph and greatness."
 VIE_Organize_VoBi_Mil_Academies_desc:0 "Any capable military force must be well aware of the fact that it is not only the present that matters. Our current line up of officers and personnel, no matter how professional and capable they are, will all retire one day. It may seem distant right now, but we must immediately begin preparing for this future.\n\nAs such, many native Võ-Bi (Military Preparation) Academies are being opened or reformed all over the country. In due time, it is our hope that a new generation of hundreds of young Vietnamese officers will graduate with full distinction, ready to take on the mantle of the National Army and continue its glorious traditions."
 VIE_National_Army_Vietnam_desc:0 "The newly established Vietnamese National Army must be one that is exactly in line with its name, a powerful National Armed Force that serves the interest of the state as a whole. It must not be segregated on a basis as petty and intangible as regionalism or ethnicity, and instead aims to protect all citizens living within our borders equally.\n\nThus, no expenses shall be spared to ensure that our military is centralized under one command, with all branches working together in harmony. An order made in the north will be one that could be heard in the south, and all soldiers will be Vietnamese first and foremost, anything else second."
 VIE_Mission_Militarie_Franccaise_Indochine_desc:0 "Despite just emerging out of a devastating war that saw their homelands occupied, the global powerhouse that is France is still gracious enough to become the main benefactor behind our young regime. Having a deep interest in maintaining influence over the region, they have posted a comprehensive military mission in our country.\n\nWe must count ourselves lucky because young nations like ours usually are not fortunate enough to have immediate access to something as game-changing as a major foreign power’s backing. It is imperative that we do not waste this opportunity and utilize it to the fullest to get our new National Army in top shape. French advisors shall direct our strategies, and French rifles will fill our troops’ hands."
 VIE_Expand_Territoire_Autonome_Battalions_desc:0 "Vietnam is a diverse country, with dozens of different ethnicities living on its land since time immemorial. Our newly formed National Army, while still operating on an unified structure, must be one that reflects this reality and not simply a force dominated by the Kinh people.\n\nOur French benefactors already have a pretty good idea of what such an undertaking might look like that we need only improve upon. We shall expand on the concept of Autonomous Territory Battalions and grant further self-determination to these units consisting entirely of ethnic minorities. The armed force of the State of Vietnam will be the first of its kind, a truly multi-ethnicity military where Mèo, Muong, Nùng, Thuong, Tài, Tho, Kinh people and many more fight shoulder to shoulder defend their common homeland."
 VIE_Organize_Vietnamese_BoQuocPhong_desc:0 "Every proper army requires multiple branches that deal with different theaters of warfare, namely air, ground, and sea, and a united chain of command to oversee all of them. Ours will not attempt to reinvent the wheel and follow along with such an orthodox method of Organization, starting with the formation of the Bo Quoc-Phòng (Ministry of Defense).\n\nThis department shall be the unifying point between the numerous Branches of our Armed Forces, imbuing in them a spirit of service and a duty to protect. Harmonious cooperation between these chapters will satisfy the pressing need for an efficient and formidable defense apparatus to protect our borders, maintain internal security, and project our strength on the global stage."
 VIE_Contact_PhuDai_Army_desc:0 "Since the disastrous fall of the Republic of China to communist forces, we have found our country home to the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) that were stationed in the province of Guangxi. Unwilling to surrender to their enemies, thousands upon thousands of Chinese soldiers crossed the border and scattered all across our land, leading to chaos and disorder. Our French benefactors have taken up the task of organizing their presence, setting up various concentration camps to house these exiles with the biggest one located on the island of Phú Quoc.\n\nWhile there is the concern of our core territory literally being occupied by a foreign army, this is also a golden opportunity for us to expand upon our young National Army. These NRA troops are hardened veterans who have seen extensive action against communists, and to recruit them into our current efforts against the Viet-Minh terrorists would be a huge relief. Some nationalist elements might become agitated towards the prospect of Chinese infiltration in our armed forces, but no price is too much when we could be obtaining the service of talented generals such as Bai Chongxi and Huang Chieh."
 VIE_Organize_Recon_Armored_Battalions_desc:0 "Recognizing the need for a modern army to protect the nation, many prominent military strategists in our country have spearheaded efforts to organize and train the first few recon armored battalions for our National Army. Our French benefactors have agreed to provide vital equipment for this initiative, including a mix of tanks, armored cars, and artillery.\n\nOnce those are secured, we shall move forward with the establishment of these elite units. Skilled officers have been appointed to lead the training, focusing on instilling discipline, tactical proficiency, and teamwork. The establishment of these armored battalions, while for reconnaissance purposes only, will hopefully instill a sense of national pride among our population nonetheless. Witnessing their own soldiers equipped with modern French weaponry will surely bolster their confidence in the defense capabilities of our young nation."
 VIE_Incorporate_Religious_Sects_BinhXuyen_Forces_desc:0 "While it was our plan to completely subjugate all paramilitaries across the nation, the matter of fact is that some of these forces are surprisingly well-organized and capable, with their own comprehensive networks of finance and supply. To try and bring them into the fold would prove to be a rather arduous task, consuming time and resources that we could be using to deal with our common enemy of Viet-Minh terrorists.\n\nThat is why our Head-of-State Bao-Dai has come up with a rather genius plan of recognizing all non-communist military forces in the country as independent armies within the Vietnamese National Army. This would bolster our capability against the Viet-Minh without having to spread our troops too thin and incur expenses that we can not afford with our limited budget. Religious paramilitaries such as those of the Hòa-Hao and Cao-Dài sects will work along crime syndicates like Bình-Xuyên to wipe out the communist insurgency once and for all."
 VIE_Form_JointStaffs_desc:0 "The importance of streamlining communication and coordination between different branches of the armed forces can not be overstated. With that in mind, the establishment of the Joint Staff aims to facilitate collaboration, strategizing, and decision-making among the army, navy, air force, and other specialized units within our National Army.\n\nThe Joint Staff shall be composed of a group of highly skilled and experienced officers, selected for their expertise in various areas of military operations, intelligence, logistics, and planning. Hopefully this will set the precedent for integrated military planning and coordination, promoting a culture of collaboration that endures beyond the formative years of the nation."
 VIE_Deal_Leroys_Ambitions_desc:0 "Léon Leroy, while initially a somewhat useful asset, has become quite a headache for us. Born as the third child of a French landlord and a Vietnamese woman, he enrolled in a military school before being briefly arrested after the Japanese coup d'etat. Upon his release, the man immediately joined the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and formed his own paramilitary known as the Christian Self Defense Union Militias (UMDC).\n\nThe UMDC has garnered quite a reputation, to say the least. Despite their name, they are neither Christian in principle nor a force dedicated to mere self-preservation. Having what can only be described as an insatiable bloodlust, they have left a trail of death and destruction anywhere they go, terrorizing the countryside with horrific crimes in the name of counter-insurgency.\n\nSuch chicanery can not be allowed to continue any further. Leroy must submit to our command and cease these disturbing activities immediately. If this demand is not met, there will be heavy consequences that involve our Head-of-State Bao-Dai himself."
 VIE_Organize_National_Mobilization_desc:0 "In the face of geopolitical complexities and the threat of communist insurgency, our ability to mobilize the entire nation in defense of its sovereignty has become an essential endeavor. It is our hope that the organization of national mobilization will not only bolster the National Army's military strength but also imbue the people with a sense of collective purpose. It shall symbolize the resilience of a people determined to safeguard their independence and preserve their cultural identity.\n\nVolunteer centers and recruitment stations will be opened up throughout the country. Beyond military needs, civilians will also contribute through the provision of resources, food, and logistical support. Women can also play an instrumental role, forming auxiliary units, providing medical aid, and working in industries essential to the war effort. Every single Vietnamese shall do their part to protect our freedom and sovereignty."
 VIE_Rescue_PhatDiem_Catholic_Militias_desc:0 "Extensive plans are currently being drawn up for the eventual paradropping of French troops into the town of Phát-Diem. While appearing small and insignificant on the surface, it is actually home to a large and beautiful cathedral and the headquarter of a major diocese in northern Vietnam.\n\nThere have been reports of devout Christians in the area taking up arms and forming militias to protect themselves against the encroaching secular Viet-Minh that is known for persecuting followers of any religion. It is our hope that with the arrival of French paratroopers in Phát-Diem, we can meet up with these brave individuals fighting for their religious liberty and obtain their help in the struggle against our common enemy."
 VIE_Section_Marine_desc:0 "With its long coastline and numerous maritime trade routes, our young nation is in dire need of a dedicated navy to protect its territorial waters and vital sea lanes. This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea. Equipped with modern vessels, patrol boats, and coastal defense assets courtesy of French support, it is our goal to become a renowned force in the turbulent waters of Southeast Asia."
 VIE_Section_Air_desc:0 "To enhance our nation's military capabilities, protect territorial integrity, and respond effectively to potential aerial threats, a strategic blueprint has been drawn up to outline the key steps and measures required to form a proficient air force within the National Army.\n\nAs a fledgling nation embarking on this momentous journey, we will require a comprehensive assessment of the numerous required resources for forming the Section Air. This so far includes identifying skilled aviators and technicians, acquiring modern aircraft, as well as establishing partnerships for training and technological advancements. It will be a difficult task, but it represents a necessary pivotal step in elevating our nation's defense posture in this ever turbulent world."
 VIE_Form_Infanterie_Marine_desc:0 "It is now the right time to take a momentous stride in enhancing our military capabilities by establishing the Infanterie Marine within the National Army. The creation of this specialized unit was driven by the recognition of the need for a swift, adaptable, and amphibious force to address unique challenges posed by the diverse geography of Vietnam and its surrounding region.\n\nWe shall begin with a meticulous selection process to recruit individuals with specific skill sets suited for amphibious operations. These recruits will undergo intensive training, developing expertise in swimming, diving, coastal warfare, and conducting operations from both sea and land. Their flexibility and capacity to rapidly adapt to various terrains will make them an essential asset in safeguarding our nation's sovereignty."
 VIE_Expand_LienDoan_TuanGiang_desc:0 "While it is our dream to one day be in possession of a global blue water navy that patrols the seven seas, the fact is that we only have what can be described as a brown-water one. The Lien-Doan Tuan-Giang (River Patrol Corps) is currently our biggest naval asset, and it is of utmost importance that we utilize it to the fullest extent.\n\nThe Lien-Doan Tuan-Giang shall be expanded to become a force capable of conducting surveillance and enforcing maritime law in our numerous rivers, which will enable us to curb smuggling activities and protect our economic interests. After all, it is crucial that we secure our internal water situation before looking to expand out into the wider ocean."
 VIE_Vietnamized_Air_Officer_Corp_desc:0 "As the National Army's air force begins to take flight, we have come to recognize the need to cultivate a homegrown air officer corps to strengthen our sense of ownership and autonomy. A visionary plan to foster Vietnamese talent and leadership within our ranks has been created, promising to empower our own aviators and ensure they rise to command the skies and protect our nation.\n\nOf course, while promoting localization, we will maintain cooperation with French and French-educated aviation experts to facilitate knowledge transfer and ensure a seamless transition. Collaborative exercises and joint projects will help enhance our capabilities while also maintaining good relations with our biggest benefactor."
 VIE_Expand_PhiTruong_QuanSu_NhaTrang_desc:0 "Due to its strategic coastal location comfortably far away from any frontline action, the city of Nha-Trang has been chosen by the French Air Force to be the site of the construction of an air training center and military airfield. The Phi-Trưong Quan-Su Nha-Trang (Nha-Trang Military Airfield) will be the first of its kind in our young nation, and it would be foolish of us not to make use of the opportunity that our benefactors have provided.\n\nWe shall send our most promising personnel there, hoping that they will come out as seasoned pilots and navigators, educated by one of the foremost military powers in the world. Many resources will also be poured into expanding the physical airfield in Nha-Trang, ensuring that it can accommodate as many aircrafts as necessary in our fight against the communist insurgency."
 VIE_Recruit_TieuDoan_NhayDu_desc:0 "In the spirit of historical valor and the quest for a strong, multifaceted defense force, we have envisioned the formation of the Tieu-doan Nhay-du (Paratrooper Battalion) within the National Army. This strategic narrative will outline the path to creating an elite airborne unit, capable of swift deployment, strategic maneuvering, and bolstering our young nation's security in the face of emerging challenges.\n\nA rigorous selection process will identify skilled soldiers with exceptional physical prowess, discipline, and unwavering determination. They will be complemented by specialized training in precision landing techniques, and equipped with state-of-the-art parachuting gear, which will ensure safety, efficiency, and accuracy during airborne deployments. The Tieu-doan Nhay-du will hopefully soar with valor and control our skies in the years to come."
