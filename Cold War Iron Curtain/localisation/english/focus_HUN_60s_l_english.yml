 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Sweet_60s_in_Hungary_desc:0 "It's only been 4 years since the failed Revolution, and although we've come far, we have much work ahead of us. The relationship between the party and people are still tense, our armed forces are virtually nonexistent, and we still don't have an answer on where to take our economy, or our foreign policy. These are among the many questions we must answer over these next few years."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Prepare_For_the_8th_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Among the top priorities on our plate is the upcoming 8th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. If we wish to not be left behind by the rest of our allies, we need to affirm our current strategy, and decide our role in not only the Warsaw Pact, but on the world stage as well."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reign_in_the_Paranoia_desc:0 "Ever since the Soviet peacekeeping forces put down the failed Revolution, the members of our Party have been constantly paranoid about doing anything, or making even the slightest change, with the unfounded fear of a second invasion plaguing their minds. If we wish to accomplish anything, we must rectify this first."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintaining_Intra_Bloc_Relationships_desc:0 "Though our government is 4 years old now, we are still relatively new on the scene, and should re-evaluate and solidify our relationships with our ideological neighbors."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Western_Question_desc:0 "With our Eastern bases covered, and the Soviets placated, at least for now, we need to decide what our policy with the Western world will be. Should we follow our Comrades in East Germany, or relax our policies?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Re_Thinking_Our_Strategy_desc:0 "The violent outcry we faced in 1956, while suppressed, has shown that we cannot keep the same old policies without change. Nagy, while a counterrevolitonary traitor, won the hearts of the Hungarian proletariat, and if we wish to gain a fraction of his support, we need to make new changes."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_VIII_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Finally, after all our preparations, and planned reforms, the time for the Congress is upon us. Now that the time has come, let us lay out our new, reformed strategy..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Initiate_Small_Scale_Liberalization_desc:0 "Upon re-evaluation, perhaps Nagy's reforms weren't entirely baseless and unfounded. While we must be careful not to fall down the slippery slope of bourgeois corruption, a lot of our measures are excessive to say the least, rolling some of our most extreme policies back will be an important first step in ensuring public support for our government."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Declare_General_Amnesty_desc:0 "In an effort to shore up popular suppoort, we will surely come into conflict with some of the more hardline and conservative members of the party. At the same time, many innocent reformers were imprisoned due to their association with the traitorous Nagy. If we show mercy to our old enemies, and expel the most hardline members of our party, we can at least cement our position internally."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Realigning_Our_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "With the solidification of our reign within the party, we can now seriously confront the question of our foreign policy. After all, with our growing trade deficit, and the need to pay for our planned reforms, we need to choose who to look towards; our Eastern allies; or to smooth over our relationships with the West... with Soviet approval of course."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Curtail_the_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The AVH after the Revolition, while having noble extensions, has gone too far in their efforts to prevent another revolution. If we wish to earn the support of the people, fanatically breathing down their necks will only motivate future revolt."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expanding_Goulash_Communism_desc:0 "While our time experimenting with Goulash Communism has both been limited and short, we are already seeing its benefits. With such promising potential, it is only natural to become more ambitious with its implementation, as it will without a doubt be instrumental in ensuring popular support for the party."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Solidify_Eastern_Ties_desc:0 "While there is merit to reach out westward, this isn't reasonable at the moment. Many within the party want to pursue the West for loans, or to achieve full UN recognition. Goals, while nodble, won't benefit Hungary long-term. With our plans to increase our consumer spending, and an already unbalanced economy, Hungary doesn't have the means to pay back loans. Furthermore, we see more long-term benefit in increasing our relationships without ideological allies. All that being said, our planned reforms will likely bring about Soviet ire; do we wish to "poke the bear" so soon, especially with such a large Red Army presence within our borders?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Soviet_Aid_desc:0 "Our Comrades in Moscow have been nothing but gracious to us; from liberating us from the Fascist menace, to suppressing the bourgeois opportunists in 1956. Now that we seek to reinvigorate our relationships with the Eastern world, we should call upon their aid once more. With our plans to reorganize and develop our economy, and the need to maintain stable finances to support our plans to increase consumer spending, Moscow should be more than happy to help us once more, and without the threat of facing ire if we extended the same request westward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_East_German_Trade_desc:0 "We may not see eye to eye with our East German allies, nor can we support all of their sometimes questionable choices; but they are still an ally. Not to mention, while perhaps not as robust, or efficient as it could be, their economic strides are admirable. We both can only gain from expanding our economic ties with them."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reinvigorate_Soviet_Trade_desc:0 "The importance of trade within our economy cannot be understated. Be it from imports or exports, we cannot deny a significant portion of our bottom line comes from it. That being said, we cannot pretend our trade deficit doesn't exist. Willing to aid us before, despite the potential costs attached to it, it would be foolish of them not to see the mutual long-term benefits. If the Soviet Union can cover our trade deficit while we develop our economy, we can avoid complications with seeking Western aid, while being able to provide a temporary solution to one of our biggest problems."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Czechoslovakian_Trade_desc:0 "Although we haven't always seen eye to eye, even clashing over Slovakian territory in the past, Hungary and Czechoslovakia both now stand on the same side of the battlefield. With being direct neighbors, supporting friendly relations, and more comprehensive mutual economic ties has potential for great mutual benefit."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Yesterdays_Foe_Todays_Friend_desc:0 "To say that Hungary's relationship with Romania has been a strained one would perhaps be the greatest understatement of the decade. However, Hungary is in a new age, an age of peace, at least so we hope. In this new age, Hungary has new allies, and Romania is one of them. If we want to be effective allies, and explore diplomatic solutions to our goals, we will open up a door to a vast array of options that were once possible. Though we cannot overdo it, we still need to take the first steps forward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Deepen_Polish_Trade_Ties_desc:0 "Hungary's modern relationship with Poland has always been give-and-take, especially after the tragedy that was the Second World War. Now, however, we stand together as friends, or, at least we are supposed to. We both share somewhat similar economic issues, and we both have much to gain from working together. Let us take the first steps towards recovery together."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Pursue_Further_COMECON_Integration_desc:0 "If we wish to find a permanent solution to our trade deficit, we must expand our production capabilities; but at the same time, it is extremely difficult to expand our production capabilities if we are consistently in a state of financial shortcoming due to our trade deficits. Integrating deeper within COMECON provides us with a temporary solution to both of these problems, as our allies can help cover our deficits, as well as provide us with much-needed help in developing our production capabilities. We cannot count on COMECON forever; as nice as that would be, but for now, it is our best long term economic solution, even if only temporarily."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Ferryman_of_Europe_desc:0 "To say we need to choose just the East or just the West is quite foolish. We will forever be grateful for what the Soviets have done for us; however, we have pressing problems we need solved as quickly as possible. While long-term economic investment and management is the ideal, Hungary does not have the resources to do it right now, and we cannot expect the Soviets to do everything for us. However, if Hungary can gain Western recognition, perhaps they can provide us with immediate financial aid. Sure, we run the risk of falling into the trap of withdrawing too many loans; but, granted we invest properly, Hungary will be more than capable of paying them back when the time comes, right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Regain_Bloc_Normal_Status_desc:0 "Our status in the Warsaw Pact and in the wider world has been greatly stifled since the Hungarian Revolution. Many refuse to even recognize our government in the wake of the Soviet invasion. If Hungary ever wishes to gain diplomatic normalcy and succeed in bridging the gaps between NATO and the Warsaw pact, we need to rectify this immediately."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Western_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Hungary doesn't seek to Westernize, nor do we seek to abandon our Eastern allies, but if we wish to reach new heights, we need to reach out to both sides of the world. Eastern and Western Europe may be divided, but that doesn't mean we cannot reach across the wall."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reassure_the_Soviets_desc:0 "Despite our Western overtures, we are nothing but loyal to Comrade [SOV.GetLeader]. While we want to expand our Western economic and diplomatic ties, Hungary's role in the Eastern Bloc is a position we take with pride, and we should make sure the Soviets know this."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Meet_with_De_Gaulle_desc:0 "If Hungary is to secure Western relationships, a meeting with De Gaulle will go a long way in cementing our legitimacy to both the West and France, and will hopefully lay the foundations of future financial cooperation with the Western bloc."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Start_Trading_With_the_West_desc:0 "Now that Hungary has largely smoothed things over with the Western world, we can finally start opening up new trade enterprises and filling our deficit. While Hungary may face long-term financial setbacks, we will hopefully be in a better position to handle it then than we have been. All that matters is that Hungary gets goods on the shelves, and our industries get resources they need, regardless of long-term consequences."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Attempt_to_Soften_East_West_Relations_desc:0 "Just because Hungary is pursuing closer relations with the Western world, doesn't mean we should exclude our Eastern allies from the benefits. Truthfully, both East and West have much to gain if we can successfully smooth over tensions."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Consider_Western_Loans_desc:0 "With normalcy in the East restored in 1956, and new relationships established with the West; with even recognition from Western countries, we can finally pursue a stop-gap solution to our growing consumer spending. With Western financial loans, Hungary cannot only sustain its spending, but fund further economic development. Surely we will be able to pay these back when the time comes, right?"
