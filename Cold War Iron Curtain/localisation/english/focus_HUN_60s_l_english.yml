 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Sweet_60s_in_Hungary_desc:0 "It's only been 4 years since the failed Revolution, and although we've come far, we have much work ahead of us. The relationship between the party and people are still tense, our armed forces are virtually nonexistent, and we still don't have an answer on where to take our economy, or our foreign policy. These are among the many questions we must answer over these next few years."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Prepare_For_the_8th_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Among the top priorities on our plate is the upcoming 8th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. If we wish to not be left behind by the rest of our allies, we need to affirm our current strategy, and decide our role in not only the Warsaw Pact, but on the world stage as well."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reign_in_the_Paranoia_desc:0 "Ever since the Soviet peacekeeping forces put down the failed Revolution, the members of our Party have been constantly paranoid about doing anything, or making even the slightest change, with the unfounded fear of a second invasion plaguing their minds. If we wish to accomplish anything, we must rectify this first."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintaining_Intra_Bloc_Relationships_desc:0 "Though our government is 4 years old now, we are still relatively new on the scene, and should re-evaluate and solidify our relationships with our ideological neighbors."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Western_Question_desc:0 "With our Eastern bases covered, and the Soviets placated, at least for now, we need to decide what our policy with the Western world will be. Should we follow our Comrades in East Germany, or relax our policies?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Re_Thinking_Our_Strategy_desc:0 "The violent outcry we faced in 1956, while suppressed, has shown that we cannot keep the same old policies without change. Nagy, while a counterrevolitonary traitor, won the hearts of the Hungarian proletariat, and if we wish to gain a fraction of his support, we need to make new changes."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_VIII_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Finally, after all our preparations, and planned reforms, the time for the Congress is upon us. Now that the time has come, let us lay out our new, reformed strategy..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Initiate_Small_Scale_Liberalization_desc:0 "Upon re-evaluation, perhaps Nagy's reforms weren't entirely baseless and unfounded. While we must be careful not to fall down the slippery slope of bourgeois corruption, a lot of our measures are excessive to say the least, rolling some of our most extreme policies back will be an important first step in ensuring public support for our government."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Declare_General_Amnesty_desc:0 "In an effort to shore up popular suppoort, we will surely come into conflict with some of the more hardline and conservative members of the party. At the same time, many innocent reformers were imprisoned due to their association with the traitorous Nagy. If we show mercy to our old enemies, and expel the most hardline members of our party, we can at least cement our position internally."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Realigning_Our_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "With the solidification of our reign within the party, we can now seriously confront the question of our foreign policy. After all, with our growing trade deficit, and the need to pay for our planned reforms, we need to choose who to look towards: our Eastern allies; or to smooth over our relationships with the West... with Soviet approval of course."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Curtail_the_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The AVH after the Revolition, while having noble extensions, has gone too far in their efforts to prevent another revolution. If we wish to earn the support of the people, fanatically breathing down their necks will only motivate future revolt."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expanding_Goulash_Communism_desc:0 "While our time experimenting with Goulash Communism has both been limited and short, we are already seeing its benefits. With such promising potential, it is only natural to become more ambitious with its implementation, as it will without a doubt be instrumental in ensuring popular support for the party."
