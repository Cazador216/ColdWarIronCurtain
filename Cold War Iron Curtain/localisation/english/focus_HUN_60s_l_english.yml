 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Sweet_60s_in_Hungary_desc:0 "It's only been 4 years since the failed Revolution, and although we've come far, we have much work ahead of us. The relationship between the party and people are still tense, our armed forces are virtually nonexistent, and we still don't have an answer on where to take our economy, or our foreign policy. These are among the many questions we must answer over these next few years."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Prepare_For_the_8th_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Among the top priorities on our plate is the upcoming 8th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. If we wish to not be left behind by the rest of our allies, we need to affirm our current strategy, and decide our role in not only the Warsaw Pact, but on the world stage as well."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reign_in_the_Paranoia_desc:0 "Ever since the Soviet peacekeeping forces put down the failed Revolution, the members of our Party have been constantly paranoid about doing anything, or making even the slightest change, with the unfounded fear of a second invasion plaguing their minds. If we wish to accomplish anything, we must rectify this first."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintaining_Intra_Bloc_Relationships_desc:0 "Though our government is 4 years old now, we are still relatively new on the scene, and should re-evaluate and solidify our relationships with our ideological neighbors."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Western_Question_desc:0 "With our Eastern bases covered, and the Soviets placated, at least for now, we need to decide what our policy with the Western world will be. Should we follow our Comrades in East Germany, or relax our policies?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Re_Thinking_Our_Strategy_desc:0 "The violent outcry we faced in 1956, while suppressed, has shown that we cannot keep the same old policies without change. Nagy, while a counterrevolitonary traitor, won the hearts of the Hungarian proletariat, and if we wish to gain a fraction of his support, we need to make new changes."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_VIII_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Finally, after all our preparations, and planned reforms, the time for the Congress is upon us. Now that the time has come, let us lay out our new, reformed strategy..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Initiate_Small_Scale_Liberalization_desc:0 "Upon re-evaluation, perhaps Nagy's reforms weren't entirely baseless and unfounded. While we must be careful not to fall down the slippery slope of bourgeois corruption, a lot of our measures are excessive to say the least, rolling some of our most extreme policies back will be an important first step in ensuring public support for our government."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Declare_General_Amnesty_desc:0 "In an effort to shore up popular suppoort, we will surely come into conflict with some of the more hardline and conservative members of the party. At the same time, many innocent reformers were imprisoned due to their association with the traitorous Nagy. If we show mercy to our old enemies, and expel the most hardline members of our party, we can at least cement our position internally."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Realigning_Our_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "With the solidification of our reign within the party, we can now seriously confront the question of our foreign policy. After all, with our growing trade deficit, and the need to pay for our planned reforms, we need to choose who to look towards; our Eastern allies; or to smooth over our relationships with the West... with Soviet approval of course."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Curtail_the_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The AVH after the Revolition, while having noble extensions, has gone too far in their efforts to prevent another revolution. If we wish to earn the support of the people, fanatically breathing down their necks will only motivate future revolt."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expanding_Goulash_Communism_desc:0 "While our time experimenting with Goulash Communism has both been limited and short, we are already seeing its benefits. With such promising potential, it is only natural to become more ambitious with its implementation, as it will without a doubt be instrumental in ensuring popular support for the party."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Solidify_Eastern_Ties_desc:0 "While there is merit to reach out westward, this isn't reasonable at the moment. Many within the party want to pursue the West for loans, or to achieve full UN recognition. Goals, while nodble, won't benefit Hungary long-term. With our plans to increase our consumer spending, and an already unbalanced economy, Hungary doesn't have the means to pay back loans. Furthermore, we see more long-term benefit in increasing our relationships without ideological allies. All that being said, our planned reforms will likely bring about Soviet ire; do we wish to "poke the bear" so soon, especially with such a large Red Army presence within our borders?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Soviet_Aid_desc:0 "Our Comrades in Moscow have been nothing but gracious to us; from liberating us from the Fascist menace, to suppressing the bourgeois opportunists in 1956. Now that we seek to reinvigorate our relationships with the Eastern world, we should call upon their aid once more. With our plans to reorganize and develop our economy, and the need to maintain stable finances to support our plans to increase consumer spending, Moscow should be more than happy to help us once more, and without the threat of facing ire if we extended the same request westward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_East_German_Trade_desc:0 "We may not see eye to eye with our East German allies, nor can we support all of their sometimes questionable choices; but they are still an ally. Not to mention, while perhaps not as robust, or efficient as it could be, their economic strides are admirable. We both can only gain from expanding our economic ties with them."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reinvigorate_Soviet_Trade_desc:0 "The importance of trade within our economy cannot be understated. Be it from imports or exports, we cannot deny a significant portion of our bottom line comes from it. That being said, we cannot pretend our trade deficit doesn't exist. Willing to aid us before, despite the potential costs attached to it, it would be foolish of them not to see the mutual long-term benefits. If the Soviet Union can cover our trade deficit while we develop our economy, we can avoid complications with seeking Western aid, while being able to provide a temporary solution to one of our biggest problems."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Czechoslovakian_Trade_desc:0 "Although we haven't always seen eye to eye, even clashing over Slovakian territory in the past, Hungary and Czechoslovakia both now stand on the same side of the battlefield. With being direct neighbors, supporting friendly relations, and more comprehensive mutual economic ties has potential for great mutual benefit."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Yesterdays_Foe_Todays_Friend_desc:0 "To say that Hungary's relationship with Romania has been a strained one would perhaps be the greatest understatement of the decade. However, Hungary is in a new age, an age of peace, at least so we hope. In this new age, Hungary has new allies, and Romania is one of them. If we want to be effective allies, and explore diplomatic solutions to our goals, we will open up a door to a vast array of options that were once possible. Though we cannot overdo it, we still need to take the first steps forward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Deepen_Polish_Trade_Ties_desc:0 "Hungary's modern relationship with Poland has always been give-and-take, especially after the tragedy that was the Second World War. Now, however, we stand together as friends, or, at least we are supposed to. We both share somewhat similar economic issues, and we both have much to gain from working together. Let us take the first steps towards recovery together."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Pursue_Further_COMECON_Integration_desc:0 "If we wish to find a permanent solution to our trade deficit, we must expand our production capabilities; but at the same time, it is extremely difficult to expand our production capabilities if we are consistently in a state of financial shortcoming due to our trade deficits. Integrating deeper within COMECON provides us with a temporary solution to both of these problems, as our allies can help cover our deficits, as well as provide us with much-needed help in developing our production capabilities. We cannot count on COMECON forever; as nice as that would be, but for now, it is our best long term economic solution, even if only temporarily."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Ferryman_of_Europe_desc:0 "To say we need to choose just the East or just the West is quite foolish. We will forever be grateful for what the Soviets have done for us; however, we have pressing problems we need solved as quickly as possible. While long-term economic investment and management is the ideal, Hungary does not have the resources to do it right now, and we cannot expect the Soviets to do everything for us. However, if Hungary can gain Western recognition, perhaps they can provide us with immediate financial aid. Sure, we run the risk of falling into the trap of withdrawing too many loans; but, granted we invest properly, Hungary will be more than capable of paying them back when the time comes, right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Regain_Bloc_Normal_Status_desc:0 "Our status in the Warsaw Pact and in the wider world has been greatly stifled since the Hungarian Revolution. Many refuse to even recognize our government in the wake of the Soviet invasion. If Hungary ever wishes to gain diplomatic normalcy and succeed in bridging the gaps between NATO and the Warsaw pact, we need to rectify this immediately."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Western_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Hungary doesn't seek to Westernize, nor do we seek to abandon our Eastern allies, but if we wish to reach new heights, we need to reach out to both sides of the world. Eastern and Western Europe may be divided, but that doesn't mean we cannot reach across the wall."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reassure_the_Soviets_desc:0 "Despite our Western overtures, we are nothing but loyal to Comrade [SOV.GetLeader]. While we want to expand our Western economic and diplomatic ties, Hungary's role in the Eastern Bloc is a position we take with pride, and we should make sure the Soviets know this."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Meet_with_De_Gaulle_desc:0 "If Hungary is to secure Western relationships, a meeting with De Gaulle will go a long way in cementing our legitimacy to both the West and France, and will hopefully lay the foundations of future financial cooperation with the Western bloc."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Start_Trading_With_the_West_desc:0 "Now that Hungary has largely smoothed things over with the Western world, we can finally start opening up new trade enterprises and filling our deficit. While Hungary may face long-term financial setbacks, we will hopefully be in a better position to handle it then than we have been. All that matters is that Hungary gets goods on the shelves, and our industries get resources they need, regardless of long-term consequences."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Attempt_to_Soften_East_West_Relations_desc:0 "Just because Hungary is pursuing closer relations with the Western world, doesn't mean we should exclude our Eastern allies from the benefits. Truthfully, both East and West have much to gain if we can successfully smooth over tensions."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Consider_Western_Loans_desc:0 "With normalcy in the East restored in 1956, and new relationships established with the West; with even recognition from Western countries, we can finally pursue a stop-gap solution to our growing consumer spending. With Western financial loans, Hungary cannot only sustain its spending, but fund further economic development. Surely we will be able to pay these back when the time comes, right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Handle_Rising_Anti_Kadar_Sentiment_desc:0 "The last decade has been absolutely astounding for Hungary. Cultural liberalization, unprecedented economic growth, coupled with our success in quelling dissent and anger from the crushed 1956 Revolution. However, not all is safe and secure, as many within the party are starting to raise their concerns."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Address_Growing_Party_Unrest_desc:0 "It seems we have greatly underestimated the discontent our reforms have caused within the party. This is far more serious than we first anticipated, and we cannot simply hope it passes with time. Kadar needs to find a solution, and quickly."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Remaining_Hardliners_desc:0 "Former Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku continues to have considerable sway within the party, having gained notoriety in his swfit and effective punishment of dissidents post-Revolution; even serving as Deputy Prime Minister from 1961 to 1962. Despite this, he may not be as trustworthy as we first thought."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Attempt_to_Cement_Kadars_Authority_desc:0 "To maintain a stable government, and placate the opposition, we need to reaffirm the role of the party in Hungarian society. With the bulk of our opposition coming from conservatives and hardliners, perhaps we can temporarily appease them, before wringing them out entirely."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Promote_Reformers_to_High_Party_Positions_desc:0 "While we got rid of the bulk of the party hardliners in the 1960's, there are still enough conservatives left making the transition to our new doctrine all the more difficult. Perhaps we can solve this gridlock by replacing them with more loyal reformists."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_A_Letter_to_the_Soviets_desc:0 "Bela Biszku, former Minister of the Interior, once Kadar's right-hand man, has effectively been demoted and disgraced. That being said, his influence has not diminished, nor can we simply remove him from the party or arrest him considering the inner-party backlash that we would face, not to mention that it would undermine our new course. Biszku has next to no ability fo affect our policy, so we can leave him be for now... though, Hungarian intelligence has determined he has been exchanging letters with Moscow... certainly that's nothing to worry about, right? Right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rethinking_Military_Strategy_desc:0 "While we have had quite the interesting military history, from the medieval Magyars to the long-lasting legacy of Austria-Hungary, and our armed forces during the Second World War, times have changed, and so have Hungary's needs. Why should we continue to drain our already depleted treasury into something we simply do not need?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reduce_Military_Expenditures_desc:0 "Our brothers in Moscow already have the defense of the East's borders with NATO and Yugoslavia covered, while Hungary is flanked by allies on all sides. While we don't need to completely demilitarize, our finances will be better spent elsewhere."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Shifting_Our_Resources_desc:0 "With substantial resources now free from military control, we can now re-invest them into our economy. Hungary still hasn't solved its trade deficit, and need to find ways to maintain consumer spending. Besides, once we successfully restructure our economy, we can always re-invest our resources later."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Join_the_Soviets_in_Prague_desc:0 "Our Czech comrades have made the same mistake the traitor Imre Nagy made nearly over a decade ago, and Hungary simply cannot let this stand. Besides, our policy professes total loyalty to the Soviet Union, in exchange for relative freedom in how we manage our internal situation, and we aren't about to risk violating that or calling down another invasion on ourselves."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Increase_Soviet_Reliance_desc:0 "One day Hungary will be able to rely on its own domestic armed forces, and one day, we can provide a significant military contribution to the Warsaw Pact. But that day is not today, and we desperately need to shift our focus to the civilian economy. With significant Soviet military presence across the country already established, we should further rely on them for protection in this critical restructuring phase."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rely_on_Soviet_Designs_desc:0 "During the 1930's and 1940's, Hungary had the ability to provide and develop our own indigenous designs. Even as early as the Austro-Hungarian period, we even threw around concepts and prototypes for new tanks and weapons. Times however have changed, and as our military industry continues to take a backseat, we need to rely on our Soviet comrades for arms and vehicles. Besides, sharing designs will increase cohesion with our allies."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Continue_Using_Soviet_Weapons_desc:0 "While we do have a small production base, it is not nearly enough to equip an army by itself, even as we are downsizing. However, not only do our brothers in Moscow have reliable weaponry, but are willing to share it with us, even if it is a bit outdated."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Buy_Into_Soviet_Armor_Development_desc:0 "If we are trying to downsize our army, and still rely on the Soviets for weapons, what makes us think it is possible to produce our own tanks? While this is a long-term goal to strive for, it simply is not possible right now. Besides, using the same tanks as the Soviets will allow us to repair and refit them much quicker, and with less strain on our industry."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Our_Air_Bases_desc:0 "As we have professed before, Hungary does not seek total demilitarization, just temporary downsizing. That being said, that does not mean we cannot innovate and expand at the same time. While we reduce our ground ofrces, we can still increase our air forces. Maintaining an air force will be far simpler than a sizable ground force, and probably more useful long-term. Besides, we are certain Comrade [SOV.GetLeader] will be pleased with higher-quality front-line bases."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Bolster_Domestic_Forces_desc:0 "With our increased focus on the domestic center, that does not mean we cannot use it to benefit the military. There is potential profit from a military industry, as well as long term benefit, and employment opportunity. We can shift some of the money we would have used to fund our armed forces into expanding our heavy indsutry for more long-term benefit."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rebuilding_Our_Air_Force_desc:0 "Largely left to collect dust and sit in neglect, the Hungarian People's Army Air Force has been nothing but an utter joke in the aftermath of 1956. While we downsize our ground forces, we should shift our attention in modernizing our air force, as the longer we wait, the more expensive and difficult it will be down the road."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Utilize_Soviet_Jet_Technology_desc:0 "Unfortunately, unlike the United States and Soviet Union, Hungary has never been at the forefront of modern jet technology. However, this does not give us an excuse to simply sit back and not innovate. While we don't have a local base to start from or build on, Moscow does. We can learn from their technology, inform our own scientists, and begin our own research base in the future."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Develop_Hungarian_MIG_19s_desc:0 "Our research has taught us much, and supplied us with a sturdy, reliable, but temporary starting point for our new air force. The MiG-19, while not the most original aircraft, is quite advanced, and will do well as a temporary mainstay in our air force."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Receive_Czech_IL_28s_desc:0 "Multi-role and interceptor technology is much different from bomber technology. While it has always been that way, and is a given, we still have no base of our own to work with, and Hungary cannot just crawl to Moscow to solve every problem we have. However, our Czech comrades seem to have things well handled. Perhaps they'd be willing to lend a helping hand?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Further_Expanding_Air_Force_Bases_desc:0 "What good is a renovated air force if we have nowhere to deploy our aircraft in our own country? Not to mention, Hungary is part of the Warsaw Pact's front line against Western aggression. If we wish to make use of our advances thus far, we need to give them ample space for storage and usage."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Form_Magyar_Aviation_Clubs_desc:0 "Learning how to create and design new aircraft models is good, and an important step in modernizing our air force, but what good is it if our pilors don't know how to fly the aircraft? If we expand the reach and funding of aviation clubs, that should help keep Hungarian pilots up to date with current doctrine and technology."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Innovate_Anti_Air_Technology_desc:0 "Just as aircraft have changed, so have the ways to shoot them down. Gone are the days of fortified flak cannons and towers. If we wish to avoid our cities being destroyed by the first onslaught of NATO bombings, Hungary needs to modernize with the rest of the world."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reinforce_the_Gyor_Air_Base_desc:0 "While not as crucial a frontline as the East Germans or Czechs, we are still a part of the Warsaw Pact's frontline nonetheless. As such, if this Cold War ever grows hot, we need to ensure we are prepared as possible to react to any threats. Increasing the capacity of our airfields in Gyor for Soviet pilots, and modernizing our radar placements will go a long way to fortifying our position."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Import_the_Strela_desc:0 "Just as stationary anti-air capabilities have changed, so has mobile anti-air systems. If Hungary wishes to keep up, we once again should look to Moscow. The 9K31 Strela is quite the impressive vehicle, being light and fast enough to readily deploy our existing units with, and it should be inoffensive enough for the Soviets to let us borrow a few."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Pursue_Helicopter_Innovations_desc:0 "The helicopter is a relatively new addition to modern militaries. While it is still far too early to know what type of role they will play in modern warfare, let alone in our army, Hungary should get ahead of the curve, and study them while we can, so we don't need to play catch up in the future."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Bring_the_Mi_4_to_Hungary_desc:0 "If Hungary actually wants to study helicopters, we need an actual helicopter to study to begin with. While we cannot justify asking for the most up-to-date models from our allies, the Mi-4 will do just fine. After all, these are just for study and future development, not combat."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Develop_Aerial_Transport_Capabilities_desc:0 "In our studies, we have realized the amazing potential that helicopters have to not only supply our units, but quickly transport them from battlefield to battlefield. In our current position, a small, mobile army is not only ideal, but it is all that we can afford. We should not waste any time in adjusting our doctrine to accommodate our discovery."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Unexpected_Cultural_Impacts_of_Goulash_Communism:0 "Goulash Communism was meant to rapidly reform our economy and politics, both to modernize our nation and reverse the damage Nagy caused, but also to grant our people more rights and freedoms in line with what Comrade [SOV.GetLeader] has decreed. However, there have been welcome but unexpected side effects in our culture as a whole."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Unequal_Inequality_desc:0 "In a state that professes unity, equality, and progress, it is not hard to see that some are more equal than others. Growing calls from homosexuals, as well as calls for female suffrage are ringing throughout the country, even if in small numbers. Regardless, we cannot simply ignore the issue and push it off for later; this must be addressed immediately."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Debate_of_Hungarian_Suffrage_desc:0 "The role of women in Hungarian society is absolutely undeniable. However, that role is highly contentious; historically, women have been simply mothers and nothing more. But now, we are a modern society, and have no need for such archiac laws, especially as a socialist state. However, do we really want to break what works?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Magyar_Mothers_Nothing_More_desc:0 "Perhaps our forefathers were right; women, in the factory? How could we even have entertained the idea? The role of women in the revolutionary society should be in the home. Our revolution is for the worker, and a woman cannot be a worker."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_An_Equal_Counterpart_desc:0 "We don't live in the 1940's anymore, let alone the 50's. Our people crave freedom and equality, and as communists it is our duty to provide that. Our women are just as much members of the proletariat as the men, and we should recognize them accordingly."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_In_the_Home_and_the_Factory_desc:0 "Like all our workers, women have responsibilities not just at home but also in the workplace. If we mean to enfranchise them, we need to get them working. While perhaps unorthodox in other places, our industry should have no problem hiring either sex."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_New_Protections_for_Women_desc:0 "We've paid enough lip service, now it is finally time to officially enshrine the rights of women alongside the rights of men, equal partners in both revolution and in law."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Mothers_of_Our_Workers_desc:0 "While not workers themselves, women play a just as important role in our society (or so we tell them). There is nothing more important than bringing life into this world, especially a life that will one day join the proletariat. How can a woman be a mother if she is toiling in the factory?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Repeal_Old_Legislation_desc:0 "We've never been at the forefront of gender equality, but we still have old legislation that is getting in the way of our end goals. While many may condemn us as cruel and even outdated, repealing certain freedoms are really in their best interest, even if they don't know it yet."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Queer_Magyars_desc:0 "Just as with the status of women in our society, those who identify themselves as queer, while not substantial by any means, still exist within our People's Republic. Most of the world condemns them, and while we have no reason to, after all, a queer proletariat is still a proletariat nonetheless. However, should we really bother, is it really that important?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintain_the_Database_desc:0 "We have no love for the German-aligned government of the late 1930's and early 40's. However, they did have useful tools, like the Homosexual Database, which was used to keep track of homosexuals and those deemed "undesirable" based on sexuality. While we won't use it to hunt them down or prosecute identified homosexuals, we should keep it around."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_A_United_Hungary_desc:0 "Gay or straight, who cares? A worker is a worker, a farmer is a farmer, and a communist is a communist, regardless of their sexuality. It would be absolutely hypocritical and a travesty if we did not recognize this."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Destroy_the_Database_desc:0 "We want nothing to do with the government of old. A government, responsible for so much pain, suffering, and death before our glorious People's Republic. One of the tools they used to persecute us was the Homosexual Database. This Database has no place in modern Magyar society, and should have been destroyed years ago."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Full_Legalization_of_Hungarian_Homosexuality_desc:0 "We've made many strides, and won a few victories for our queer comrades. With the Database eradicated, it is high time we officially granted our queer comrades equality, not just in rhetoric, but in law."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Traditional_Hungarian_Sexual_Values_desc:0 "Everything is fine, and while we detest our old ways, society was stable, and after the failed counter-revolution in 1956, that is exactly what we need now. Maybe, just maybe one day in the future this will change, but right now, stability is the priority, and we cannot change what works for such a small group of people."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Ignore_Growing_Dissent_desc:0 "We're far from the ways of Rakosi and his brutality. Our refusal to reform has caused much unrest, but a harsh crackdown will only worsen our position. We're trying to distance ourselves from pre-revolutionary policy, and build true Hungarian Socialism. So, for now, we can turn a blind eye to the protests and riots..."
