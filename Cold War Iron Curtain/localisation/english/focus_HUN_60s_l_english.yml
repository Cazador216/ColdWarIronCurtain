 HUN_KADAR_ECON.1.d:0 "One of the largest economic problems we face as a nation is our trade deficit.  We’ve been forced to deal with this issue for decades with no luck, and recently it only seems to be getting worse, the implication of which is absolutely mortifying for our economy, which is increasingly reliant on foreign trade.  What makes this issue even more necessary to solve is the fact that our reforms are genuinely popular with our people, and many both in, and out of the party believe that if we can maintain our current growth, and keep to the road comrade Kadar has laid out, the threat of the fall of Socialism in Hungary can potentially be averted entirely!  All that being said, we need to solve this problem as soon as possible, and in doing so, while there are many things we can do to alleviate the situation, we’ve only got two options to choose from if we seek a long term solution.  We can either reach out to the west, gain new trade routes and greatly expand who we import and export to and from.  The alternative is to greatly expand our trade routes in the east, and seek long term relief from the Soviet Union, who’s proven more than willing to provide us with the aid we need.\n\nOn one hand, opening to the west will be an important step in getting our government internationally recognized, and greatly expanding the volume we import and export.  However this neglects our pre-existing trade routes, will likely create a logistic nightmare for our economists to try and get goods across NATO and Warsaw Pact borders, and likely won't give us any long term solutions so long as the Cold War continues.  The alternative will see an improvement of trade infrastructure across the Eastern Bloc, aid the efficiency of CMEA, and if the Soviets agree to our proposal, likely could see them take on and fill our trade deficit entirely by themselves.  This however makes us increasingly reliant on Moscow, makes no headway in receiving international recognition for our government, and if the Soviets refuse, we will find ourselves right back where we started, but with even less options then we had beforehand."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.2.d:0 "Today the Kremlin has received a perplexing request from Budapest, as Kadar and his government seek to overcome the nation's economic hurdles.  Hungary, even after crushing the rebellion in 1956, has held a more ambivalent stance towards the western world then most of our allies.  Hungary's main economic hurdle, even before instating Kadar as its new leader, was its ever growing trade deficit.  Due to Hungary's flirtation with western europe in their attempts in receiving international recognition (an initiative we’ve been more than happy to assist them with), Budapest has decided to make the right decision and come to us yet again for help.  However, the extent of what Hungary is asking of us has got many in the CPSU undecided over whether we should accept their request.  Ultimately, Hungary is asking us to take on, and fill their trade deficit for them.  On one hand, this will ensure the longevity of Hungarian socialism, ensuring it’s longevity even without our guiding hand, which in turn alleviates a lot of administrative concern and stress.  Furthermore, it will potentially, quite permanently bind Hungary to Moscow economically, not to mention the benefits of an economically strong and stable Hungary will without a doubt outway the costs of helping them.  Another point in Hungary's favor is the unquestionable loyalty Kadar has shown, toeing the line without fail, and following our directives and orders without complaint, and with a diligence unmatched by our other allies.  On the other hand, taking on their entire deficit will rip a considerable amount of money from our own treasury, and given the precarious nature within the CPSU currently, and our own set of growing problems, there are some in the party who don’t believe we’re in a position to take this burden on right now.  Regardless, Budapest is waiting for a reply, and we’d rather not keep them waiting long."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.21.d:0 "Great news from Moscow!  The Soviets have decided to save us yet again, and have agreed to take on our trade deficit!  While it may not solve the problems of growing consumer spending, or directly aid in economic modernization, they have ensured that we don’t fall into an ever growing debt pit we can’t climb out of, and in the long term, very likely saved our economy, by filling our deficit.  Now with extensive breathing room, we can pursue Kadars full vision without any risk of crisis, or pressure, and we can guarantee our people are never found wanting for the foreseeable future.  While many may not know it, Kadarism is here to say, thanks to the generosity of Moscow."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.22.d:0 "Grave news from Moscow today, as it seems our luck has run out.  While more than willing to save us before, it seems the Soviets have reached their limit and refused to take on our deficit.  While they cite their own internal issues as to why, we’ve already committed to our eastern allies, and begun burning our admittedly small remaining bridges with the western world.  With no solution for our deficit, and reaching out to the west becoming increasingly impossible, we can only desperately hope we can find another solution…"
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.6.d:0 "If we were to compare any of our major cities to that of a moderately sized city in western europe, the pathetic state of our infrastructure couldn’t be more obvious.  Poor roads, underwhelming highways, extensive rural settlements, lack of modern railways, and pitifully maintained, and miniscule metros dotting our cities, no one in good conscience calls us a modern country.  However, under Kadars guidance, and the ever growing attention the parties placed on our economy, we’re ready to devote vast resources in the total overhaul of our nation's infrastructure in its entirety.  New roads, new railways, and even grand expansion of the Budapest metro, will bring us a long way towards the goal of total modernization, and under Kadars guidance, we can guarantee our people can be proud to live in a Hungarian city"
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.3.d:0:0 "As we continue to expand the role of the market economy under the socialist system, we’re faced with the crucial question regarding the fate of our agriculture.  Collectivization has worked for us, so far without fail, and while it has its shortcomings, it isn’t anything small scale reform, and more funding can’t solve.  If we stay the course, and push for full agricultural collectivization, which we are on the verge of as is, the ability to feed our people will never be a worry, nor fear for the foreseeable future.  That being said, it likely won't go over well with the peasants, a group we in particular have struggled to win over, not to mention the growing reformist voices in the Party believe that de-collectivization will not only increase profit from our farms, but also make our economy more compatible with western ones, ensuring ease of trade and investment without fully moving away from economic socialism.  However sudden, immediate change never ends well, risks absolutely destroying current agricultural productivity, while removing the role of the state in ensuring our farmers have access to the most modern technologies will put more financial pressure on our people.  Regardless, if we fail to see either choice all the way through, famine and agricultural collapse will inevitably follow."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.10.d:0:0 "Our efforts to renovate Hungarian agriculture have proven to be a resounding success!  While we didn’t face any major problems with food availability, our farms were far from modern, and our farmers far from content.  Now however, our farmers live comfortable, are properly compensated for their labor.  Modern technology, renovated homes and record agricultural productivity, our administration hasn’t been this popular since Imre Nagy usurped our legal government!  Not only that, with the excess we now enjoy, at the very least for now, we have an extended revenue stream to pay for our growing consumer spending, and have a new avenue to fill our trade deficit, selling Hungarian crops across our allies' borders.  With our farms secure and happy, we can now fully, reliably re-direct our attention to more pressing crises knowing we have a solid foundation to stand on."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.11.d:0:0 "Breaking News from Budapest sparks fear across the Soviet Bloc yet again, however this time, not over an invasion.  Recently, Janos Kadar and his administration had announced a concentrated effort to fully renovate, and modernize Hungary's farms, and ensure long term agrarian stability.  However, as of this morning, reports have shown a complete breakdown in Hungarian agriculture, as a self-inflicted famine now ravages the country.  While the worst seems to be prevented, due to a desperate increase in grain imports from the Soviet Union, this is without a doubt a devastating blow to Kadars administration, one built already on a shaky, unpopular foundation, now being forced to rollback nearly all previously initiated reforms in the field.  A nation still in the throes of industrialization, the long term implications for the Hungarian economy equally aren’t looking good, especially given the government's refusal to roll back its increased spending on consumer goods, threatening to escalate from a famine to a wider economic crisis.  Only time will tell if Hungary can recover, as yet another humiliation strikes the Soviet Sphere."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.7.d:0:0 "Goulash Communism has reaped many benefits for our economy, and has stood as proof that Kadar is taking Hungary down the right path.  Now however, we’re preparing to initiate the large-scale reform plan for our economy.  The New Economic Mechanism, or NEM, will be the long term guiding hand of our economy, and will seek to initiate sweeping reforms, abandoning planned economics nearly entirely and transitioning into a primarily profit based economic model, while maintaining socialist principles.  While the road will be difficult, and changes will likely need to be made as time goes on, that is ultimately the nature of reform, and we will proudly make any necessary changes, for the sake of economic stability, and progress."
 HUN_KADAR_ECON.8.d:0:0 "Just as Comrade Kadars previous reforms, the NEM has proven to be a near complete success.  While we still face minor issues, such as competing with western markets, and finding new ways to keep up with our consumer goods spending, our economy is growing at a record pace, our industry is expanding, store shelves are filled with Hungarian goods and our roads are fresh and well maintained.  The rapid success of our economic reforms even have many heads in Moscow turning, and the once hostile relationship we held with the wider population has all but disappeared, as we finally enjoy wide popular support.  To many, we’ve achieved the impossible, and to many in the party, we’ve only just gotten started."

These are among the many questions we must answer over these next few years."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Prepare_For_the_8th_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Among the top priorities on our plate is the upcoming 8th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. If we wish to not be left behind by the rest of our allies, we need to affirm our current strategy, and decide our role in not only the Warsaw Pact, but on the world stage as well."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reign_in_the_Paranoia_desc:0 "Ever since the Soviet peacekeeping forces put down the failed Revolution, the members of our Party have been constantly paranoid about doing anything, or making even the slightest change, with the unfounded fear of a second invasion plaguing their minds. If we wish to accomplish anything, we must rectify this first."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintaining_Intra_Bloc_Relationships_desc:0 "Though our government is 4 years old now, we are still relatively new on the scene, and should re-evaluate and solidify our relationships with our ideological neighbors."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Western_Question_desc:0 "With our Eastern bases covered, and the Soviets placated, at least for now, we need to decide what our policy with the Western world will be. Should we follow our Comrades in East Germany, or relax our policies?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Re_Thinking_Our_Strategy_desc:0 "The violent outcry we faced in 1956, while suppressed, has shown that we cannot keep the same old policies without change. Nagy, while a counterrevolitonary traitor, won the hearts of the Hungarian proletariat, and if we wish to gain a fraction of his support, we need to make new changes."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_VIII_Party_Congress_desc:0 "Finally, after all our preparations, and planned reforms, the time for the Congress is upon us. Now that the time has come, let us lay out our new, reformed strategy..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Initiate_Small_Scale_Liberalization_desc:0 "Upon re-evaluation, perhaps Nagy's reforms weren't entirely baseless and unfounded. While we must be careful not to fall down the slippery slope of bourgeois corruption, a lot of our measures are excessive to say the least, rolling some of our most extreme policies back will be an important first step in ensuring public support for our government."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Declare_General_Amnesty_desc:0 "In an effort to shore up popular suppoort, we will surely come into conflict with some of the more hardline and conservative members of the party. At the same time, many innocent reformers were imprisoned due to their association with the traitorous Nagy. If we show mercy to our old enemies, and expel the most hardline members of our party, we can at least cement our position internally."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Realigning_Our_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "With the solidification of our reign within the party, we can now seriously confront the question of our foreign policy. After all, with our growing trade deficit, and the need to pay for our planned reforms, we need to choose who to look towards; our Eastern allies; or to smooth over our relationships with the West... with Soviet approval of course."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Curtail_the_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The AVH after the Revolition, while having noble extensions, has gone too far in their efforts to prevent another revolution. If we wish to earn the support of the people, fanatically breathing down their necks will only motivate future revolt."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expanding_Goulash_Communism_desc:0 "While our time experimenting with Goulash Communism has both been limited and short, we are already seeing its benefits. With such promising potential, it is only natural to become more ambitious with its implementation, as it will without a doubt be instrumental in ensuring popular support for the party."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Solidify_Eastern_Ties_desc:0 "While there is merit to reach out westward, this isn't reasonable at the moment. Many within the party want to pursue the West for loans, or to achieve full UN recognition. Goals, while nodble, won't benefit Hungary long-term. With our plans to increase our consumer spending, and an already unbalanced economy, Hungary doesn't have the means to pay back loans. Furthermore, we see more long-term benefit in increasing our relationships without ideological allies. All that being said, our planned reforms will likely bring about Soviet ire; do we wish to "poke the bear" so soon, especially with such a large Red Army presence within our borders?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Soviet_Aid_desc:0 "Our Comrades in Moscow have been nothing but gracious to us; from liberating us from the Fascist menace, to suppressing the bourgeois opportunists in 1956. Now that we seek to reinvigorate our relationships with the Eastern world, we should call upon their aid once more. With our plans to reorganize and develop our economy, and the need to maintain stable finances to support our plans to increase consumer spending, Moscow should be more than happy to help us once more, and without the threat of facing ire if we extended the same request westward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_East_German_Trade_desc:0 "We may not see eye to eye with our East German allies, nor can we support all of their sometimes questionable choices; but they are still an ally. Not to mention, while perhaps not as robust, or efficient as it could be, their economic strides are admirable. We both can only gain from expanding our economic ties with them."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reinvigorate_Soviet_Trade_desc:0 "The importance of trade within our economy cannot be understated. Be it from imports or exports, we cannot deny a significant portion of our bottom line comes from it. That being said, we cannot pretend our trade deficit doesn't exist. Willing to aid us before, despite the potential costs attached to it, it would be foolish of them not to see the mutual long-term benefits. If the Soviet Union can cover our trade deficit while we develop our economy, we can avoid complications with seeking Western aid, while being able to provide a temporary solution to one of our biggest problems."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Czechoslovakian_Trade_desc:0 "Although we haven't always seen eye to eye, even clashing over Slovakian territory in the past, Hungary and Czechoslovakia both now stand on the same side of the battlefield. With being direct neighbors, supporting friendly relations, and more comprehensive mutual economic ties has potential for great mutual benefit."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Yesterdays_Foe_Todays_Friend_desc:0 "To say that Hungary's relationship with Romania has been a strained one would perhaps be the greatest understatement of the decade. However, Hungary is in a new age, an age of peace, at least so we hope. In this new age, Hungary has new allies, and Romania is one of them. If we want to be effective allies, and explore diplomatic solutions to our goals, we will open up a door to a vast array of options that were once possible. Though we cannot overdo it, we still need to take the first steps forward."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Deepen_Polish_Trade_Ties_desc:0 "Hungary's modern relationship with Poland has always been give-and-take, especially after the tragedy that was the Second World War. Now, however, we stand together as friends, or, at least we are supposed to. We both share somewhat similar economic issues, and we both have much to gain from working together. Let us take the first steps towards recovery together."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Pursue_Further_COMECON_Integration_desc:0 "If we wish to find a permanent solution to our trade deficit, we must expand our production capabilities; but at the same time, it is extremely difficult to expand our production capabilities if we are consistently in a state of financial shortcoming due to our trade deficits. Integrating deeper within COMECON provides us with a temporary solution to both of these problems, as our allies can help cover our deficits, as well as provide us with much-needed help in developing our production capabilities. We cannot count on COMECON forever; as nice as that would be, but for now, it is our best long term economic solution, even if only temporarily."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Ferryman_of_Europe_desc:0 "To say we need to choose just the East or just the West is quite foolish. We will forever be grateful for what the Soviets have done for us; however, we have pressing problems we need solved as quickly as possible. While long-term economic investment and management is the ideal, Hungary does not have the resources to do it right now, and we cannot expect the Soviets to do everything for us. However, if Hungary can gain Western recognition, perhaps they can provide us with immediate financial aid. Sure, we run the risk of falling into the trap of withdrawing too many loans; but, granted we invest properly, Hungary will be more than capable of paying them back when the time comes, right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Regain_Bloc_Normal_Status_desc:0 "Our status in the Warsaw Pact and in the wider world has been greatly stifled since the Hungarian Revolution. Many refuse to even recognize our government in the wake of the Soviet invasion. If Hungary ever wishes to gain diplomatic normalcy and succeed in bridging the gaps between NATO and the Warsaw pact, we need to rectify this immediately."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Western_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Hungary doesn't seek to Westernize, nor do we seek to abandon our Eastern allies, but if we wish to reach new heights, we need to reach out to both sides of the world. Eastern and Western Europe may be divided, but that doesn't mean we cannot reach across the wall."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reassure_the_Soviets_desc:0 "Despite our Western overtures, we are nothing but loyal to Comrade [SOV.GetLeader]. While we want to expand our Western economic and diplomatic ties, Hungary's role in the Eastern Bloc is a position we take with pride, and we should make sure the Soviets know this."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Meet_with_De_Gaulle_desc:0 "If Hungary is to secure Western relationships, a meeting with De Gaulle will go a long way in cementing our legitimacy to both the West and France, and will hopefully lay the foundations of future financial cooperation with the Western bloc."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Start_Trading_With_the_West_desc:0 "Now that Hungary has largely smoothed things over with the Western world, we can finally start opening up new trade enterprises and filling our deficit. While Hungary may face long-term financial setbacks, we will hopefully be in a better position to handle it then than we have been. All that matters is that Hungary gets goods on the shelves, and our industries get resources they need, regardless of long-term consequences."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Attempt_to_Soften_East_West_Relations_desc:0 "Just because Hungary is pursuing closer relations with the Western world, doesn't mean we should exclude our Eastern allies from the benefits. Truthfully, both East and West have much to gain if we can successfully smooth over tensions."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Consider_Western_Loans_desc:0 "With normalcy in the East restored in 1956, and new relationships established with the West; with even recognition from Western countries, we can finally pursue a stop-gap solution to our growing consumer spending. With Western financial loans, Hungary cannot only sustain its spending, but fund further economic development. Surely we will be able to pay these back when the time comes, right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Handle_Rising_Anti_Kadar_Sentiment_desc:0 "The last decade has been absolutely astounding for Hungary. Cultural liberalization, unprecedented economic growth, coupled with our success in quelling dissent and anger from the crushed 1956 Revolution. However, not all is safe and secure, as many within the party are starting to raise their concerns."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Address_Growing_Party_Unrest_desc:0 "It seems we have greatly underestimated the discontent our reforms have caused within the party. This is far more serious than we first anticipated, and we cannot simply hope it passes with time. Kadar needs to find a solution, and quickly."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Remaining_Hardliners_desc:0 "Former Minister of the Interior Bela Biszku continues to have considerable sway within the party, having gained notoriety in his swfit and effective punishment of dissidents post-Revolution; even serving as Deputy Prime Minister from 1961 to 1962. Despite this, he may not be as trustworthy as we first thought."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Attempt_to_Cement_Kadars_Authority_desc:0 "To maintain a stable government, and placate the opposition, we need to reaffirm the role of the party in Hungarian society. With the bulk of our opposition coming from conservatives and hardliners, perhaps we can temporarily appease them, before wringing them out entirely."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Promote_Reformers_to_High_Party_Positions_desc:0 "While we got rid of the bulk of the party hardliners in the 1960's, there are still enough conservatives left making the transition to our new doctrine all the more difficult. Perhaps we can solve this gridlock by replacing them with more loyal reformists."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_A_Letter_to_the_Soviets_desc:0 "Bela Biszku, former Minister of the Interior, once Kadar's right-hand man, has effectively been demoted and disgraced. That being said, his influence has not diminished, nor can we simply remove him from the party or arrest him considering the inner-party backlash that we would face, not to mention that it would undermine our new course. Biszku has next to no ability fo affect our policy, so we can leave him be for now... though, Hungarian intelligence has determined he has been exchanging letters with Moscow... certainly that's nothing to worry about, right? Right?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rethinking_Military_Strategy_desc:0 "While we have had quite the interesting military history, from the medieval Magyars to the long-lasting legacy of Austria-Hungary, and our armed forces during the Second World War, times have changed, and so have Hungary's needs. Why should we continue to drain our already depleted treasury into something we simply do not need?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reduce_Military_Expenditures_desc:0 "Our brothers in Moscow already have the defense of the East's borders with NATO and Yugoslavia covered, while Hungary is flanked by allies on all sides. While we don't need to completely demilitarize, our finances will be better spent elsewhere."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Shifting_Our_Resources_desc:0 "With substantial resources now free from military control, we can now re-invest them into our economy. Hungary still hasn't solved its trade deficit, and need to find ways to maintain consumer spending. Besides, once we successfully restructure our economy, we can always re-invest our resources later."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Join_the_Soviets_in_Prague_desc:0 "Our Czech comrades have made the same mistake the traitor Imre Nagy made nearly over a decade ago, and Hungary simply cannot let this stand. Besides, our policy professes total loyalty to the Soviet Union, in exchange for relative freedom in how we manage our internal situation, and we aren't about to risk violating that or calling down another invasion on ourselves."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Increase_Soviet_Reliance_desc:0 "One day Hungary will be able to rely on its own domestic armed forces, and one day, we can provide a significant military contribution to the Warsaw Pact. But that day is not today, and we desperately need to shift our focus to the civilian economy. With significant Soviet military presence across the country already established, we should further rely on them for protection in this critical restructuring phase."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rely_on_Soviet_Designs_desc:0 "During the 1930's and 1940's, Hungary had the ability to provide and develop our own indigenous designs. Even as early as the Austro-Hungarian period, we even threw around concepts and prototypes for new tanks and weapons. Times however have changed, and as our military industry continues to take a backseat, we need to rely on our Soviet comrades for arms and vehicles. Besides, sharing designs will increase cohesion with our allies."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Continue_Using_Soviet_Weapons_desc:0 "While we do have a small production base, it is not nearly enough to equip an army by itself, even as we are downsizing. However, not only do our brothers in Moscow have reliable weaponry, but are willing to share it with us, even if it is a bit outdated."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Buy_Into_Soviet_Armor_Development_desc:0 "If we are trying to downsize our army, and still rely on the Soviets for weapons, what makes us think it is possible to produce our own tanks? While this is a long-term goal to strive for, it simply is not possible right now. Besides, using the same tanks as the Soviets will allow us to repair and refit them much quicker, and with less strain on our industry."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Our_Air_Bases_desc:0 "As we have professed before, Hungary does not seek total demilitarization, just temporary downsizing. That being said, that does not mean we cannot innovate and expand at the same time. While we reduce our ground ofrces, we can still increase our air forces. Maintaining an air force will be far simpler than a sizable ground force, and probably more useful long-term. Besides, we are certain Comrade [SOV.GetLeader] will be pleased with higher-quality front-line bases."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Bolster_Domestic_Forces_desc:0 "With our increased focus on the domestic center, that does not mean we cannot use it to benefit the military. There is potential profit from a military industry, as well as long term benefit, and employment opportunity. We can shift some of the money we would have used to fund our armed forces into expanding our heavy indsutry for more long-term benefit."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rebuilding_Our_Air_Force_desc:0 "Largely left to collect dust and sit in neglect, the Hungarian People's Army Air Force has been nothing but an utter joke in the aftermath of 1956. While we downsize our ground forces, we should shift our attention in modernizing our air force, as the longer we wait, the more expensive and difficult it will be down the road."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Utilize_Soviet_Jet_Technology_desc:0 "Unfortunately, unlike the United States and Soviet Union, Hungary has never been at the forefront of modern jet technology. However, this does not give us an excuse to simply sit back and not innovate. While we don't have a local base to start from or build on, Moscow does. We can learn from their technology, inform our own scientists, and begin our own research base in the future."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Develop_Hungarian_MIG_19s_desc:0 "Our research has taught us much, and supplied us with a sturdy, reliable, but temporary starting point for our new air force. The MiG-19, while not the most original aircraft, is quite advanced, and will do well as a temporary mainstay in our air force."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Receive_Czech_IL_28s_desc:0 "Multi-role and interceptor technology is much different from bomber technology. While it has always been that way, and is a given, we still have no base of our own to work with, and Hungary cannot just crawl to Moscow to solve every problem we have. However, our Czech comrades seem to have things well handled. Perhaps they'd be willing to lend a helping hand?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Further_Expanding_Air_Force_Bases_desc:0 "What good is a renovated air force if we have nowhere to deploy our aircraft in our own country? Not to mention, Hungary is part of the Warsaw Pact's front line against Western aggression. If we wish to make use of our advances thus far, we need to give them ample space for storage and usage."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Form_Magyar_Aviation_Clubs_desc:0 "Learning how to create and design new aircraft models is good, and an important step in modernizing our air force, but what good is it if our pilors don't know how to fly the aircraft? If we expand the reach and funding of aviation clubs, that should help keep Hungarian pilots up to date with current doctrine and technology."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Innovate_Anti_Air_Technology_desc:0 "Just as aircraft have changed, so have the ways to shoot them down. Gone are the days of fortified flak cannons and towers. If we wish to avoid our cities being destroyed by the first onslaught of NATO bombings, Hungary needs to modernize with the rest of the world."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Reinforce_the_Gyor_Air_Base_desc:0 "While not as crucial a frontline as the East Germans or Czechs, we are still a part of the Warsaw Pact's frontline nonetheless. As such, if this Cold War ever grows hot, we need to ensure we are prepared as possible to react to any threats. Increasing the capacity of our airfields in Gyor for Soviet pilots, and modernizing our radar placements will go a long way to fortifying our position."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Import_the_Strela_desc:0 "Just as stationary anti-air capabilities have changed, so has mobile anti-air systems. If Hungary wishes to keep up, we once again should look to Moscow. The 9K31 Strela is quite the impressive vehicle, being light and fast enough to readily deploy our existing units with, and it should be inoffensive enough for the Soviets to let us borrow a few."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Pursue_Helicopter_Innovations_desc:0 "The helicopter is a relatively new addition to modern militaries. While it is still far too early to know what type of role they will play in modern warfare, let alone in our army, Hungary should get ahead of the curve, and study them while we can, so we don't need to play catch up in the future."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Bring_the_Mi_4_to_Hungary_desc:0 "If Hungary actually wants to study helicopters, we need an actual helicopter to study to begin with. While we cannot justify asking for the most up-to-date models from our allies, the Mi-4 will do just fine. After all, these are just for study and future development, not combat."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Develop_Aerial_Transport_Capabilities_desc:0 "In our studies, we have realized the amazing potential that helicopters have to not only supply our units, but quickly transport them from battlefield to battlefield. In our current position, a small, mobile army is not only ideal, but it is all that we can afford. We should not waste any time in adjusting our doctrine to accommodate our discovery."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Unexpected_Cultural_Impacts_of_Goulash_Communism:0 "Goulash Communism was meant to rapidly reform our economy and politics, both to modernize our nation and reverse the damage Nagy caused, but also to grant our people more rights and freedoms in line with what Comrade [SOV.GetLeader] has decreed. However, there have been welcome but unexpected side effects in our culture as a whole."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Unequal_Inequality_desc:0 "In a state that professes unity, equality, and progress, it is not hard to see that some are more equal than others. Growing calls from homosexuals, as well as calls for female suffrage are ringing throughout the country, even if in small numbers. Regardless, we cannot simply ignore the issue and push it off for later; this must be addressed immediately."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Debate_of_Hungarian_Suffrage_desc:0 "The role of women in Hungarian society is absolutely undeniable. However, that role is highly contentious; historically, women have been simply mothers and nothing more. But now, we are a modern society, and have no need for such archiac laws, especially as a socialist state. However, do we really want to break what works?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Magyar_Mothers_Nothing_More_desc:0 "Perhaps our forefathers were right; women, in the factory? How could we even have entertained the idea? The role of women in the revolutionary society should be in the home. Our revolution is for the worker, and a woman cannot be a worker."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_An_Equal_Counterpart_desc:0 "We don't live in the 1940's anymore, let alone the 50's. Our people crave freedom and equality, and as communists it is our duty to provide that. Our women are just as much members of the proletariat as the men, and we should recognize them accordingly."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_In_the_Home_and_the_Factory_desc:0 "Like all our workers, women have responsibilities not just at home but also in the workplace. If we mean to enfranchise them, we need to get them working. While perhaps unorthodox in other places, our industry should have no problem hiring either sex."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_New_Protections_for_Women_desc:0 "We've paid enough lip service, now it is finally time to officially enshrine the rights of women alongside the rights of men, equal partners in both revolution and in law."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Mothers_of_Our_Workers_desc:0 "While not workers themselves, women play a just as important role in our society (or so we tell them). There is nothing more important than bringing life into this world, especially a life that will one day join the proletariat. How can a woman be a mother if she is toiling in the factory?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Repeal_Old_Legislation_desc:0 "We've never been at the forefront of gender equality, but we still have old legislation that is getting in the way of our end goals. While many may condemn us as cruel and even outdated, repealing certain freedoms are really in their best interest, even if they don't know it yet."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Queer_Magyars_desc:0 "Just as with the status of women in our society, those who identify themselves as queer, while not substantial by any means, still exist within our People's Republic. Most of the world condemns them, and while we have no reason to, after all, a queer proletariat is still a proletariat nonetheless. However, should we really bother, is it really that important?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Maintain_the_Database_desc:0 "We have no love for the German-aligned government of the late 1930's and early 40's. However, they did have useful tools, like the Homosexual Database, which was used to keep track of homosexuals and those deemed "undesirable" based on sexuality. While we won't use it to hunt them down or prosecute identified homosexuals, we should keep it around."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_A_United_Hungary_desc:0 "Gay or straight, who cares? A worker is a worker, a farmer is a farmer, and a communist is a communist, regardless of their sexuality. It would be absolutely hypocritical and a travesty if we did not recognize this."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Destroy_the_Database_desc:0 "We want nothing to do with the government of old. A government, responsible for so much pain, suffering, and death before our glorious People's Republic. One of the tools they used to persecute us was the Homosexual Database. This Database has no place in modern Magyar society, and should have been destroyed years ago."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Full_Legalization_of_Hungarian_Homosexuality_desc:0 "We've made many strides, and won a few victories for our queer comrades. With the Database eradicated, it is high time we officially granted our queer comrades equality, not just in rhetoric, but in law."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Traditional_Hungarian_Sexual_Values_desc:0 "Everything is fine, and while we detest our old ways, society was stable, and after the failed counter-revolution in 1956, that is exactly what we need now. Maybe, just maybe one day in the future this will change, but right now, stability is the priority, and we cannot change what works for such a small group of people."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Ignore_Growing_Dissent_desc:0 "We're far from the ways of Rakosi and his brutality. Our refusal to reform has caused much unrest, but a harsh crackdown will only worsen our position. We're trying to distance ourselves from pre-revolutionary policy, and build true Hungarian Socialism. So, for now, we can turn a blind eye to the protests and riots..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_A_Hungarian_Musical_Golden_Age_desc:0 "Communication technology only improves with time, and while our Soviet comrades mastered the art of propaganda in both film and radio, we shouldn't allow ourselves to fall behind."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Magyar_Radio_Es_Televizio_desc:0 "It isn't much of a stretch to say that we aren't the most modern country. But that doesn't mean we can't strive to elevate ourselves. While this entails much responsibility, why not start small and in the homes of our people?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Our_First_Colored_Broadcast_desc:0 "The world is full of color, and so shall our televisions. It is not particularly controversial to say that Hungary is behind a lot of Europe, and every little bit country, so being able to provide colored TV broadcasts is a crucial step."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Establish_MTV_Archives_desc:0 "Television history is undeniably going to be an important piece of cultre, and something we can look back on many years from now. So why not start archiving early?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Rural_Television_desc:0 "If we are to be a true government of the people, that also extends to the peasants. While generally more conservative, we can always slowly change their mind by providing them with not only basic amentities, but the truth, over the television."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Magyar_Rock_and_Roll_desc:0 "Music is an absolutely wonderful thing. While our allies repress Western styles, what's stopping us from embracing it, and using it for our own purposes?"
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Consumerism_In_Our_Music_desc:0 "Our policies, both in our culture and in our economy have led to some, while not undesirable, odd side effects. Consumerism is now playing an unpredictable role in the development of our new revolutionary culture, and it's found a home in our music as well."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Education_Through_Media_desc:0 "Education is the crux of developing a long-term communist society. While we obviously cannot force workers into schools or force farmers into the classroom, we can still give them a helping hand, via our media."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Adapt_Western_Advertisement_Methods_desc:0 "Advertisements are an absolutely critical part in allowing the capitalist system to function. While we must be careful not to adopt such a wretched ideology, it doesn't mean we cannot use Western methods to further our own goals."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Enshrine_Sellars_desc:0 "The sellers, while in capitalist countries, are nothing but bourgeois tools; in Hungary, they are simple intermediaries for the people to access necessary goods. This role should be protected, and respected."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Capacity_of_Schools_desc:0 "Ensuring class consciousness should be one of our lead priorities in building socialism in Hungary. Furthermore, educating our people is a goal we cannot simply ignore; perhaps we can kill two birds with one stone..."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Stay_the_Course_desc:0 "With the end goal of class consciousness, ideological education and the righteous truth of socialist realism must be maintained. Ideological education is a core pillar we cannot ignore, let alone replace."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Ideology_Doesnt_Belong_In_the_Classroom_desc:0 "We can achieve class consciousness in other ways. After all, continuing to provide and increase the quality of life for our people is plenty. We should strictly stick to an educational curriculum, and keep politics out of it."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Mold_the_Workers_of_Tomorrow_desc:0 "Our greatest long-term ally is the youth if we want to ensure our continuing rule. If they do not support us, they will be our downfall in the future. We need to mold them as soon as possible and accordingly, we need to assert our educational policy, ideally sooner rather than later."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Expand_Technical_and_Vocational_Education_desc:0 "If we seek to make long-term progress in asserting socialism in Hungary, we need to ensure the youth is taught practical and ncessary skills they will need when entering the workforce."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Force_Peasants_Into_the_Classroom_desc:0 "It is not just the industrial worker or the future scientists and soldiers we need to educate but the peasant as well. While we may not always want to admit it and while we will one day rid ourselves of such backwards principles, they are still a vital part of our population that we cannot ignore. Bringing them into the classroom is the first step towards progress."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Fund_Comprehensive_Engineering_Education_desc:0 "While the workers of today are our present and our immediate proletariat, the youth is the proletariat of tomorrow. If we ever hope to succeed in the long term, we cannot simply devote all our energy onto just one of these groups, and need to ensure our children receive just as much care as our adult workers."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Recruit_Soviet_Professors_desc:0 "We may not always wish to admit when we need help, but if our ambitious education plans are to take root, we need to acknowledge our shortcomings in terms of staffing our new classrooms. Who better to turn to for such aid than the ones who saved us from counter-revolution."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Introduce_Russian_Language_Studies_desc:0 "Many may not see the immediate need to study Russian. If we wish for our workers to succeed in the Soviet sphere or to thrive in a Soviet-centered world, we need to ensure our people are able to work in it to begin with, even if that means learning a new language or two."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Examine_Household_Goods_Availability_desc:0 "As we pursue the further commodification of our economy, basic luxuries are an important aspect of that goal. Our government may not be popular now, but we can very easily change that."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Hungarian_Games_For_Hungarian_Families_desc:0 "An important aspect of ensuring the popularity of our people's government is ensuring the happiness of our people. Our government stands for the uplifting of the proletariat, and that doesn't just mean in the workplace."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_The_Role_of_Commodities_in_Socialist_Society_desc:0 "Commodity production under capitalist methods is exploitative, and has no place in any modern country of the 20th century. However, that does not extend to all its forms. Taking commodity production and distribution under a socialist lens will surely be the solution."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Made_in_Hungary_desc:0 "As our consumer sector grows, our quality and quantity can only be matched by the mighty superpowers of our day and age. We must not squander this opportunity, and display our success outside our borders."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Magyar_Cultural_Exports_desc:0 "It is not just products and resources that we export. Very few people know, let alone care, about the plight of Hungarian socialism, and if we seek approval and recognition from both the East and the West, then we have no choice but to do something about it."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Household_Radios_and_Televisions_desc:0 "Unlike some of our socialist counterparts, we are under no false illusion of modernity. We recognize how far behind we are, even behind some of the lesser-developed Western nations. That doesn't mean we cannot work to change that, and an important step is to ensure households have regular access to basic civil technologies."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Import_the_Volga_desc:0 "While we do eventually want to get out own automobile industry off the ground, we still need to ensure our people have ready access to vehicles until then. The Soviet "Volga" series of cars are a solid and reliable car that can function more than just a simple stop-gap."
 HUN_60s_Kadar_Import_East_German_Cars_desc:0 "East Germany is a country struggling just as much if not more than us. However, that does not mean they've done nothing good, especially in regards to their automobiles. Perhaps we can receive mutual benefit, and slowly fill our ever growing trade deficit by working with our socialist brother."
