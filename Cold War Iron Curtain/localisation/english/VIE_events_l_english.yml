### Phu Dai Army 1950's Events ###
PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet's Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang's forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang's forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China's Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this “Republic” seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

Elysee_Accords.1.t:0 "The Elysée Accords"
Elysee_Accords.1.d:0 "At the Elysee Palace in the distant land of France, a historic agreement has been reached that will forever change the future of the millions of citizens within our territory. Our young nation recognized internationally as the State of Vietnam shall be granted greater independence from France within the multi continental system of the French Union, a momentous accomplishment that was the culmination of months of hard work by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai. The Elysee Accords will now move to the French National Assembly, to be officially ratified and signed by the French president.\n\nThe accords stated that Vietnam could now conduct its own foreign affairs, control its finances and have an army. Specifically, we were granted the right to appoint diplomats to China, Thailand, and the Vatican City, but the remainder of our foreign policy will remain under French guidance. Some may decry this as falling short of granting complete independence, but the matter of fact is that this was the best we could have got, especially in such turbulent times where pushing our French benefactors away would be complete suicide."
Elysee_Accords.1.a:0 "Slow and steady wins the race."

Elysee_Accords.2.t:0 "The Second Article of the Elysée Accords"
Elysee_Accords.2.d:0 "Although the Accords have granted us a slither of independence from the French, we do not yet have complete freedom in our diplomatic affairs. We can only appoint diplomats to the Republic of China, Thailand, and Vatican City. Though we will not be able to have any major impact on the world, we can still negotiate with two of our neighbors regarding any issues that may arise. Considering the current situation of the Indochinese peninsula, the French are not merely our benefactors but also our saviors from the Communist North. In the future, we may even negotiate with the Great Powers of the day as Equals and not as mere French puppets."
Elysee_Accords.2.a:0 "What they call a Bao-Dai solution turned out to be just a French solution."

CCC_Unification_Choices.1.d:0 "Earlier today, our Head-of-State Bao-Dai landed in Saigon after a short flight from Da-Lat. His arrival there signified a major step towards our reunification efforts with Cochinchina, for the former emperor was personally leading negotiations while also enjoying considerable French backing. The recent passing of a bill declaring Cochinchina to no longer be a direct French territory but instead part of the State of Vietnam in the French Assembly was a significant milestone that allowed our Head-of-State a comfortable position to leverage. With that in mind, Bao-Dai guided the subsequent negotiations…"

# CCC Unification
CCC_Unification.1.t:0 "Plead France for Vietnamese Unification"
CCC_Unification.1.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, it seems that our efforts to try and unify the \"Republic\" of Cochinchina have failed. Despite the \"warm\" relations between General Nguyen-Van-Xuan and Head of State Bao-Dai, the two cannot agree on a plausible solution to the country's problems. There are rumours that Nguyen-Van-Xuan is holding out for a different leader or, at the very least, a different solution and is stalling negotiations to unify. Bao-Dai has made the decision to appeal directly to the French. However, this may compromise the \"Purity\" of his diplomatic victory; it is believed that with their pressure, the remaining holdouts on unification will be forced to agree."
CCC_Unification.1.a:0 "Lets hope for the best."

CCC_Unification.2.t:0 "Bao-Dai Requests Unification with Cochinchina"
CCC_Unification.2.d:0 "The Head of State of Vietnam, Bao-Dai, has reached an impasse and requested our support to unify his country. As in many other cases, it seems that Bai-Dai's bark is worse than his bite. Fortunately, the main holdout to unification is Nguyen-Van-Xuan, who is loyal to us; with a certain amount of \"pressure,\" he can likely be persuaded to unify. Unifying the country might make it strong enough to start pulling its own weight in this struggle and put less pressure on our boys to sort things out. The question is whether we should continue to support Bao-Dai or if it's time for fresh blood."
CCC_Unification.2.a:0 "We'll think about it."

CCC_Unification.3.t:0 "France Requests Unification with Bao-Dai"
CCC_Unification.3.d:0 "Besides Bao-Dai's government, we have also received request from the French government for us to unite with Bao-Dai's government. Similarly, we could heed to the French request for us to join Bao-Dai's government provide that Bao-Dai follows some terms and conditions or we could refuse to join and remain an autonomous republic. However, refusing to join Bao-Dai's government would mean that Bao-Dai could take Cochinchina by force."
CCC_Unification.3.a:0 "May we build a strong Vietnam, together."
CCC_Unification.3.b:0 "We shall stand our ground."

CCC_Unification.4.t:0 "Cochinchina Agrees to Unify!"
CCC_Unification.4.d:0 "Great news has been delivered to our government recently. Our diplomatic office in Cochinchina, which is being dismantled as we speak, has just received confirmation that the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina has ceased to exist as a political entity, and instead has become integral provinces of the State of Vietnam. Our Head-of-State Bao-Dai was reported to be personally elated at this development, and there has been considerable celebration in the streets. Without a doubt, this accomplishment will further entrench our legitimacy and improve our image in the eyes of the people."
CCC_Unification.4.a:0 "Slowly but surely, Vietnam becomes one again."

CCC_Unification.5.t:0 "Cochinchina Refuses Unification!"
CCC_Unification.5.d:0 "Devastating news has just been delivered to our government today. Despite our best efforts, our diplomatic office in Cochinchina will have to stay open for a little bit longer, for we have received an insulting refusal from a representative of Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina, stating that they would not submit to the authority of what they called “the incompetent fools of the State of Vietnam.” Our Head-of-State Bao-Dai was described to be extremely outraged when he heard of this development, who then proceeded to storm out of his quarter to contact the French and request immediate intervention. Riots and unrest have enveloped our streets, as citizens flock downtown to protest what they deemed to be governmental incompetence. This is undoubtedly a major strike to our legitimacy, and it will take a long time to rebuild our image."
CCC_Unification.5.a:0 "We are divided, but not for long."

CCC_Unification.6.t:0 "A Plead from Bao-Dai"
CCC_Unification.6.d:0 "With the recent negotiation between Cochinchina and Bao-Dai's government, we have received another request from Bao-Dai again regarding the unification of Cochinchina and Annam. Bao-Dai demands us again to unify Cochinchina and Annam under one government to ensure the stability of Vietnam. Considering our situation in Vietnam right now, it is best for us to heed Bao-Dai's words and \"persuade\" Cochinchina to unify with Annam under a single Vietnamese government friendly to us."
CCC_Unification.6.a:0 "Cochinchina has played around for too long, let's end this peacefully now."

CCC_Unification.7.t:0 "A Final Ultimatum"
CCC_Unification.7.d:0 "We have received the final ultimatum from France regarding the topic of unification of Cochinchina and Annam under a single Vietnamese government. It seems that the French is now pressuring us to unite with Bao-Dai's government considering that Bao-Dai threaten to invade us if we refuse peaceful unification. We could cave to Bao-Dai's demand to ensure peace among the Vietnamese people or we could put our foot down and refuse to his demand and fight to our last breath. Beware that if we refuse Bao-Dai's term to unify, the French will not come to our defense if he sends his army against us."
CCC_Unification.7.a:0 "Maybe it is for the best."
CCC_Unification.7.b:0 "Our decision is final, we shall not bow to Bao-Dai!"

CCC_Unification.8.t:0 "Cochinchina Submits!"
CCC_Unification.8.d:0 "It is natural that our glorious leader Bao-Dai would attract Cochinchina to the State of Vietnam. General Nguyen-Van-Xuan has great respect, as he should, for the hegemony of Bao-Dai over all of Vietnam is just, promising, and natural. Bao-Dai is the greatest leader our nation ever had, in its thousands of years of history. His diplomatic skills, economic acumen, and commanding personality means he is unstoppable, and will surely crush the northern communist threat.\n\nThe unification of Cochinchina with our Central Provisional Government will lead us to unequivocal greatness. Nguyen-Van-Xuan understands that under a superior centralised government, we can defeat the communists and bring about a proper modern Vietnamese state."
CCC_Unification.8.a:0 "We Are One at Last..."

CCC_Unification.9.t:0 "Cochinchina Refuses Again!"
CCC_Unification.9.d:0 "General Nguyen-Van-Xuan has blighted the country by not accepting the unification of our lands with his occupied Cochinchina. His reluctance to band together to fight the northern communist threat will surely be a stain on Vietnam for many years to come. He claims that our former king Bao-Dai is unfit to rule because of controversies in Saigon, but these “justification” are not enough to make Bao-Dai resign or stop wanting the best of the Vietnamese people. He carries a heavy weight on his back and it is no surprise or crime for him to indulge in human pleasures. As for Nguyen-Van-Xuan, it is expected that a French sympathiser would be so greedy and power hungry. The people, and the world, will understand Bao-Dai's hegemony over all of Vietnam is justified and necessary."
CCC_Unification.9.a:0 "South Vietnam shall be united, once and for all!"

CCC_Unification.10.t:0 "Bao-Dai Takes Over Cochinchina!"
CCC_Unification.10.d:0 "Recently, Bao-Dai has arrived in Saigon to demonstrate that he has unified Cochinchina and Annam under his government. While this means that Cochinchina is lost to us for now as our troops are outnumbered by the French and their lackeys, we must not give up our dream on reunifying Vietnam. We must not stop this war until Vietnam is liberated from the imperialist!"
CCC_Unification.10.a:0 "Let us not lose hope, this is just the beginning."

Etat_du_Vietnam.1.t:0 "A Cooperative South Vietnam"
Etat_du_Vietnam.1.d:0 "Recently, our great leader Bao-Dai made an overture in Saigon in an effort to reunify Cochinchina and Annam under one government. For years, our government faces many problems across the nation such as an incompetent colonial administration, religious paramilitary groups, bandits, and a nationwide Communist insurgency from North to South. Despite these problems, Bao-Dai managed to unify Cochinchina and Annam under his rule under our new state, the State of Vietnam, or État du Viêt-Nam in French. Since Bao-Dai unified these two regions under our new government, he hopes to gain more autonomy from France by gaining control of the other Crown domains of Vietnam and destroying communism once and for all."

Etat_du_Vietnam.3.t:0 "Recognize Bao-Dai's New Regime?"
Etat_du_Vietnam.3.d:0 "With Bao-Dai's recent takeover of Cochinchina and the formation of the State of Vietnam, we have two options on how to handle this issue. We could recognize Bao-Dai's government as the legitimate government of Vietnam and begin diplomatic relation or we could refuse due to the current instability in Vietnam. Accepting Bao-Dai's government as the legitimate government of Vietnam would allow us to conduct diplomatic relation and gain new allies in Southeast Asia. However, Bao-Dai's government might not be the most reliable as an ally, so we need to be careful with our choice here."
Etat_du_Vietnam.3.a:0 "A toast, to our new anti-communist allies!"
Etat_du_Vietnam.3.b:0 "Let's keep things open for now."

Etat_du_Vietnam.4.t:0 "Bao-Dai Declares Us \"Demonic Communists\"!"
Etat_du_Vietnam.4.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, Bao-Dai has declared us as "Demonic Communists" that needs to be wiped from the Earth as soon as possible. We decided to scoff at his words considering his status as nothing more than a French lackey oppressing the people. We must continue on our goal of liberation of Vietnam from North to South from the imperialist power once and for all."
Etat_du_Vietnam.4.a:0 "He'll get what's coming to him."

Etat_du_Vietnam.5.t:0 "Nguyen-Van-Xuan Is Elected Deputy Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam"
Etat_du_Vietnam.5.d:0 "With the peaceful unification of Cochinchina and Annam, let us elect Nguyen-Van-Xuan as our Prime Minister. With his expertise as the former governor of Cochinchina, he could provide us the legitimacy that we need to the western world that we are a worthy democratic nation. Nguyen-Van-Xuan's former position as the head of the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina could also prove useful in helping us keeping Cochinchina under our control."
Etat_du_Vietnam.5.a:0 "A useful ally."

Etat_du_Vietnam.6.t:0 "Bao-Dai Remains as the Sole Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam"
Etat_du_Vietnam.6.d:0 "With the unification of Cochinchina and Annam, Bao-Dai shall remain as the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam until the next election. With Bao-Dai's leadership, we should expect a hardline stance against the Communists in Vietnam. However, Bao-Dai's hedonistic lifestyle attracts criticism from the people, which will make control of Vietnam difficult. As the sole leader of the State of Vietnam, Bao-Dai now needs to handle his position with care, lest the nation falls to Communism again."
Etat_du_Vietnam.6.a:0 "Let's hope he can keep things under control."

# Bao-Dai
BaoDai.1.t:0 "A Gift to Le-Van-Vien"
BaoDai.1.d:0 "The Emperor has recently made his close friend Le-Van-Vien a “Baron” of the Royal Family due to his increased and long-lasting support for the Emperor. Le-Van-Vien is the leader of the Binh-Xuyen Mafia who fields a large autonomous army within South Vietnam and also maintains one of the largest casinos in Southeast Asia. It is in this casino that Vien helps out Bao-Dai due to his frequent losses in gambling and conflicts with women due to his womanizing personality. Not only is Vien a Baron, but his younger brother has been adopted by the Emperor himself and has promised to make Vien a full General in the South Vietnamese Army."
BaoDai.1.a:0 "A good friend is hard to find these days."

BaoDai.2.t:0 "Da-Lat, The Summer Capital"
BaoDai.2.d:0 "Da-Lat is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Vietnam and has been used as a summer capital by the French due to its temperate weather compared to the tropical weather in the rest of the country. It has also been nicknamed the \"City of Eternal Spring\" due to year-long mists in its valleys. However, the infrastructure is woefully outdated and the Emperor has decreed that the “Summer Capital” be completely revamped with modern infrastructure and electricity to not cause any issues for the Royal Family when they come to vacation there."
BaoDai.2.a:0 "The City of a Thousand Flowers arrives in the modern era."

BaoDai.3.t:0 "Saigon, Pearl of the Orient"
BaoDai.3.d:0 "Saigon, also known as the Pearl of the Orient was the pride of French Indochina and is the capital of our state. Hence, it should be accorded the greatest respect we can give and be adorned with the most extravagant of decorations. In light of this, the Emperor has declared an extensive reformation plan which hopes to bring the city from historical antiquity up to modern standards. A modern look with a Vietnamese feel will do wonders for our prestige in front of visitors and help in inviting foreign investments into our country."
BaoDai.3.a:0 "The Pearl shines as bright as ever."

BaoDai.4.t:0 "The Manifesto of Ngo-Dinh-Diem"
BaoDai.4.d:0 "On the 6th of June 1949, a significant development unfolded as the French Secret Police, known as \"Xac-Te,\" directly contacted our government to deliver a grave warning about the peril posed by Ngo-Dinh-Diem, whom they branded a traitor. Their concerns centered on Diem's latest manifesto, which had just been published in our newspapers. This piece contained deeply unsettling and radical ideas, with the apparent intent of sowing the seeds of rebellion among our populace, urging them to rise against both our fledgling government and our French benefactors.\n\nThe Chief of Security at Xac-Te emphasized that prompt action should have been taken to remove Diem from the equation, underscoring the potential threat posed by his Christian Social Movement. The fear was that if allowed to continue, Diem could inflict further damage upon our government's struggle against the encroaching specter of northern communism and disrupt the fragile stability we sought to maintain.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Diem's manifesto, which sheds light on his ideological stance:\n\n"We must recognize that our current struggle extends beyond mere political independence for our homeland. It is, in essence, a SOCIALIST REVOLUTION, aimed at securing FREEDOM for the FARMERS AND WORKERS OF VIETNAM! Our ultimate objective is to ensure that every individual in Vietnam possesses the means of production, enabling them to lead lives of dignity. To achieve this, I advocate for progressive and bold social reforms that will not only safeguard our human dignity but also usher in an era of growth and evolution."\n\nThe urgency of the situation is undeniable, and the need to rectify our course is immediate."

Intelligence suggests that Diem has found refuge in Japan, further complicating our efforts to contain his radical agenda.\n\nRecent intelligence intercepts also indicate that Diem has had a clandestine meeting with Cuong-De, a prominent figure known for his involvement in anti-government activities. This meeting, shrouded in secrecy, hints at a potential alliance between two forces with similar aims but differing methods.\n\nCuong-De's involvement raises concerns about the depth of collaboration among various factions seeking to challenge our government's stability and French support. Diem's continued presence on the international stage, coupled with this newfound alliance, adds another layer of complexity to the evolving situation.\n\nXac-Te remains vigilant, monitoring these developments closely and assessing the implications of this unexpected meeting.

In response to his capture, Diem has unleashed a barrage of venomous tirades, vowing revenge against what he perceives as imperialists and collaborators who have sold our country's sovereignty.\n\nFrom his cell, Diem has declared his unwavering commitment to liberating Vietnam from the influence of foreign powers. He alleges that his arrest is part of a broader conspiracy to stifle the voice of the Vietnamese people seeking true independence and dignity. His fiery rhetoric has gained traction among sympathizers, setting the stage for potential unrest in the nation."

Nhu's arrest was carried out swiftly and discreetly by Xac-Te agents. His alleged involvement in the dissemination of the communist manifesto authored by Diem has fueled speculation about the depth of their collusion in a radical agenda.\n\nIn response to his brother's arrest, Diem, known for his charismatic leadership, has fled the country, seeking refuge in Japan. From an undisclosed location, he has issued a passionate proclamation, vowing to liberate his brother and the nation from what he perceives as imperialism's clutches. He alleges that Nhu's arrest is a grave injustice, a suppression of their cause to bring freedom and dignity to the people of Vietnam.\n\nDiem's rhetoric remains inflammatory and has caught the attention of sympathetic factions both within and beyond our borders.

Despite that, the throne was passed to Gia-Long's fourth son, Minh-Mang, ancestor of our current Head-of-State Bao-Dai. But the past has come back to haunt us once more, for Cuong-De, descendant of Prince Canh, has become quite a thorn in our side by utilizing his heritage to further his personal political goals.\n\nEducated in Japan, Cuong-De was a key figure in the Dong Du (On the Way to the East) movement, which sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. Facing much persecution from the French, he still nonetheless evaded capture and found the Viet-Nam Quang-Phuc Hoi (Vietnam Restoration Organisation) alongside Phan-Boi-Chau in 1911, hoping to overthrow French colonial rule in Vietnam and establish a democratic republic. The organization failed to gain momentum, crippled by arrests of its members. Cuong-De did not give up, however, and later created the Viet-Nam Phuc-quoc Dong-minh Hoi (League for the Restoration of Vietnam) in 1938 and attempted to court Japanese support.\n\nNow that order has been restored to our country and the French has returned, Cuong-De's ambitions can not be left unchecked any longer. Having given a public press conference declaring his intent to return to Vietnam and form an opposition to our government, we must make sure that this illegitimate upstart does not gain any further influence. Proposals personally drafted by Bao-Dai will be sent to major foreign powers like France and the United States requesting that they ignore Cuong-De, while a diplomatic protest will be issued to Japan for hosting him as a citizen."

Bao-Dai has restated embarrassing revelations about Cuong-De's countless past failure to liberate Vietnam and his collaboration during the Second World War have invalidated any claim to rule in Vietnam. It is believed that the statements being made by Cuong-De might be stirring up popular support in Vietnam, and the Vietnamese government is in a frenzy that Cuong-De could end their rule. The Vietnamese ambassador has emphasised that continuing to host Cuong-De will damage relations and could even lead to an embargo. The French have also expressed frustration with the statements of Cuong-De accusing him of undermining efforts to restore order in Vietnam.

In question is the island of Phu-Quoc, which is home to a small KMT exile force and is otherwise fairly small, but its position is vitally important, and abandoning our claim may shake the public perception of our government.\n\nAlternatively, abandoning a claim to a largely small and unneeded island they already administer would go a long way to reducing tensions, and may pave the way for future cooperation with South Vietnam."

Brevert_Lines.3.t:0 "Cambodia Declines"
Brevert_Lines.3.d:0 "As usual, the Khmer government has stalled and refused to attend the conference citing that, “This conference directly violated their sovereignty and sacred ancestral lands”. While we already administer and control the state, not even common sense can be counted on in global politics. Since this line also decides other aspects of our border, plans are in place to redeploy forces there if we can end this rebellion, and perhaps make them think twice of unwarranted aggression."

VIE_Sect_Militias.1.d:0 "Dear Chau,\n\nI have been sent to the Nam-Phan region, in Ben-Tre to protect our country as part of the orders from the VNA's Highcomm. Most days, nothing happens, but the fear stays; I wake up and just want to be home. I saw the news that we have new allies \"integrated\" into the army. They're not my allies; I watched as one of Leroy's \"UMDC Catholic militias\" cut and hacked through random people whom we knew were innocent; that's not the cause I thought we were fighting for. Not to mention that with some of these French's new units, if you turn your back too long, they'll shoot you. We are fighting as best as we can, but this is different than fighting the Japanese. Our French advisors and veteran officers from past world wars don't have any experience fighting something like this. We can go through a village ten times and see nothing wrong, and then the next time, we get ambushed. I'm beginning to think that some of our units are passing on information. The Khinh-Quan units are fairweather friends, and I wouldn't be surprised if they swap sides any day now."
VIE_Sect_Militias.1.a:0 "Too high is the price we pay to rid our country from the communist."

VIE_Sect_Militias.2.t:0 "Hard Decisions"
VIE_Sect_Militias.2.d:0 "In the middle of the night, several French high colonial command staff enter a utilitarian building that stands amidst lush, tropical vegetation, and the building's exterior shows signs of wear from the humid climate and occasional rain. Inside, the meeting room where the officers and Vietnamese staff members are gathered exudes an atmosphere of seriousness and tension. The room is adorned with functional furniture, such as a long wooden table and simple chairs. The walls are adorned with maps of the region and photographs of key military figures, one of them specifically being Phan-Van-Giao's.\n\nThe atmosphere is palpably tense as the officers and staff members grapple with the urgent and rising threat of the nationalistic militia group known as the Bao-Dai. A relatively mature formation of paramilitaries who had fought both for and against the Japanese oppression, but most importantly, they fought the French on every step they took. The Vietnamese staff discuss the matter with hushed voices, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The weight of responsibility and the potential consequences of their decisions hang heavy in the air, giving the room an almost suffocating feeling. Finally, the voice of a French officer broke the tense silence with a concerned tone, "We can't ignore the threat posed by this nationalistic, monarchist, militia group. They are well-armed and well-trained, and their return is certainly alarming."\n\nOutside the building, the sounds of the bustling military camp can be heard, with soldiers training, vehicles moving, and orders being barked together with the occasional dog bark. After one of those said dogs bark, a second French Officer continues with a well-put-out tone, "Agreed, their history of fighting against us makes their integration into the Vietnamese army a delicate decision as well as a difficult state of cooperation between our forces and theirs."\n\nThe humid air carries a mix of aromas, including the scent of sweat, foliage, and the faint smell of gunpowder from recent drills fills the nostrils of the high echelons of people present at this meeting. A complicated environment for complicated people and this was reflected by the following response by a Vietnamese commander, "But if we don't integrate them, they could become a destabilizing force, and arresting them might just escalate the situation further. Yet at the same time, integrating them could provide valuable insights into their motives and future actions."\n\nLowering his voice, he leans into the ear of the Vietnamese Chief of Staff so that the French would not pry on this rather sensible topic, "Remember, they are our people and they fought for our independence, regardless of our different views. There might be common ground for reconciliation." Finally, the Vietnamese army commander lifts his head and looks at the ever-suspicious French generals and comments with a calculated tone. "We must assess the risks and benefits." The French all give each other a look before one of the officers decisively comments "We should." Yet they have not come to any decision as of now. For? They have locked their eyes at the Vietnamese Chief of Staff who has been silent all this time. Waiting for his input, the tension density in the air grows to an almost palpable degree, but just before it has reached the boiling point, he spoke,"
VIE_Sect_Militias.2.a:0 "Round them up, they are just another threat to be dealt with."

VIE_PQC_Mil.1.d:0 "In the wake of our Civil War defeat and our subsequent, albeit temporary, relocation to the Taiwan base of operations, our forces have been strategically positioned in various key locations. These deployments were made in anticipation of a potential return to our homeland. Among these, a notable contingent, nearly 33,000 troops under the command of General Huang Chieh, interned themselves on the South Vietnamese island of Phu Quoc. Apart from these forces, our troops have also maintained a presence in Burma.\n\nSince their deployment, these troops have largely remained stationed in Phu Quoc but have since planned to return home. The ongoing conflict in Vietnam presents considerable risks for these forces to rejoin us, as any movement would necessitate navigating through waters controlled by the NVA and PRC or undertaking a difficult alternative route. Amidst these challenging circumstances, the South Vietnamese government has extended an intriguing proposal. They seek our army's engagement in their conflict against the Marxists in the North. Engaging our forces in this manner could significantly impact the advance of communism, a prospect that is currently under intense deliberation. It is also anticipated that such a move would likely receive support from the American side.\n\nGeneral Huang Chieh, who has been operating semi-autonomously, has yet to be informed of this proposal. We stand at a crossroads with the power to either advance this idea or dismiss it before it reaches the General. The decision presents two distinct options:"
VIE_PQC_Mil.1.a:0 "Prioritize our strategic needs and decline the proposal. Inform the President that we cannot spare these troops at this juncture."

The decision was made swiftly, with the Republic citing strategic necessities as the primary reason. They have emphasized the importance of retaining their troops for their operations, a stance that leaves us in a position where we must consider alternative strategies for reinforcing our numbers."

This proposal involves the integration of our forces into the South Vietnamese army as a semi-autonomous unit. Our primary role would be to assist in their ongoing campaign against the communist forces in the North. This opportunity, while not without risks, presents a compelling chance to halt the advance of the communists on the Indochinese peninsula.\n\nIn response to this proposal, a meeting of our officer corps has been convened to deliberate on the path forward. The decision at hand is critical."
VIE_PQC_Mil.3.a:0 "Mobilize the soldiers and make preparations for departure, contact the President and tell him we will assist."

For years, the Bao-Dai government of Vietnam faces many problems across the nation such as an incompetent colonial administration, religious paramilitary groups, bandits, and a nationwide Communist insurgency from North to South. Despite these problems, Bao-Dai managed to unify Cochinchina and Annam under his rule under the name of the State of Vietnam, or État du Viêt-Nam in French. Since Bao-Dai has unified these two regions under his control, he hopes to gain more autonomy from France by gaining control of the other Crown domains of Vietnam and destroying communism once and for all."
