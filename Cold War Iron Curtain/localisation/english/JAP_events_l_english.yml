 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "Today the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations between Japan and the Allied Powers. This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined. Moreover, Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts according to Article 11.\nThough, the signed treaty is yet to be enforced, this day means big for Japan and its people, for the nation will be finally free from the occupation."

Nevertheless, after many bitter years of enmity, Japan and America are now friends, and the Rising Sun has flown once again at the Japanese Embassy in Washington D.C. as Japan re-enters the community of free nations."

 japan.1.d:0 "Ever since the Japanese defeat at the end of the Second World War, the country has been under American military occupation and allowed no armed forces. However, with the rising tensions of the Cold War the American government has taken increasing steps towards developing Japan as a Capitalist ally in the East. With American forces facing engagements in the Korean War, Japan's incredibly exposed and vulnerable position has not gone unnoticed. Leftist and Communist-aligned strikes and demonstrations have also inflamed the situation and the United States clearly now sees it prudent to allow Japan to form its own military again. The Japanese government has now officially authorized the creation of a national military, however its role is to be limited specifically to self defense and will be tightly monitored by the US, still wary from the World War merely a decade prior. No matter the restrictions, the creation of the Japanese military helps reinforce the precarious Allied position in Asia, whilst highlighting Japan's new found national sovereignty."

 japan.3.d:0 "Japan has undergone multiple waves of municipal consolidation since the Meiji Restoration The newly proposed 'Great Showa Consolidation' will help the nation’s efforts to cope with the changes brought about by the so-called post-war reforms, especially the government acting under the new Constitution of 1946 as well as the Local Autonomy Law of 1947.  Under this postwar local government system, the roles of municipalities were enhanced and they were charged with the responsibility of operating junior high schools, carrying out fire prevention activities, and dealing with social welfare matters. With the steadily growing population, and thus, growing number of junior highschoolers, as well as the junior high school system being newly-introduced, running them is bound to burden each individual municipality.\nFor this purpose, the Great Showa Consolidation will be underpinned by two municipal merger laws in order to make running the junior highschools effective as well as polish the municipal administration. This will also help utilize the small land area of the country for booming industry and urbanization."

 japan.4.t:0 "The Red Purge"
 japan.4.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the 'Truman Doctrine', the United States had announced its unyielding stance against communism, with Japan as a target to cleanse it from far-leftist radicals. Last year, with the US diplomat, George Kennan, pressuring MacArthur to change his moderate policy, unrest spilled out between spring and summer as a series of demonstrations and protests by laborers, students and teachers, were held across the major cities of Japan. Unsurprisingly, after approval from Washington, the occupation authorities along with the Eighth Army aggressively suppressed these movements. The infamous "Hanshin Education Incident" occured in April when the Japanese authorities under the directions of the US government and the Japanese Ministry of Education closed down private Korean ethnic schools operating in Japan; it is said such actions were prompted by the fears of possible communist infiltration in the schools. Furthermore, later in September, then-Prime Minister of Japan, Hitoshi Ashida, was arrested along with some of his cabinet officials.\nWith the fresh legacy of last year's events, economic uncertainity, the Japanese Communist Party's political endeavors and the formation of the student associations, the Zengakuren, communism is only bound to spread across the nation if left unchecked; thus, the situation neccessitates the continuation of slamming the red menace."
 japan.4.a:0 "It was necessary..."
 japan.5.d:0 "As the part of the ongoing 'Red Purge' to curb the growing communist threat in Japan, the GHQ's Civil and Information and Education Section (CIE) has made plans to ensure the education system stays pure from any far-leftist ideals. For this purpose, the authorities dispatched Dr. Walter C. Eells, who serves at the GHQ as an advisor on higher education, to thirty national universities to call for immediate dismissal of communist professors and staff. On 16th July, Eells visited Niigata University and labelled communism as "dangerous and destructive doctrine". Due to his ideals, anti-communism is slowly becoming a nationwide sentiment and openly shunned by the newspapers. Plus, there have been noticeable dismissals of communist sympathizers from educational institutes, mostly over irrelevant reasons. This endeavor is commonly known as the 'Eells Typhoon', or 'Izuru Senpu', as the Japanese call it.\nSome people argue that Eells's actions are a blatant suppression of academic freedom in Japan, while some would defend him, claiming that the CIE was never directly involved in the red purge. Either way one thing remains clear, that the 'Izuru Senpu' is a critical element in the ongoing red purge."
 japan.5.a:0 "Good for him."
 japan.6.d:0 "The first president of Japanese National Railways, Sadanori Shimoyama, was recently found dead on the Joban Line, Adachi after reported missing yesterday.\nBased on the official autopsy led by Professor Tanemoto Furuhata, it was determined that Shimoyama died prior to being hit by the train, with blood loss being possible due to the lack of blood on the body. Additionally, in some parts of the body, internal bleeding was found, which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking. On the other hand, it is also believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining.\nA few days prior to his death, Shimoyama was ordered for personnel cutbacks of JNR under the Dodge Line policy and released a list of 30,000 employees to be fired. It is rumored that he recieved death threats from the high level US military officials to make sure he goes through with the order, which could have caused severe depression and hence, possible suicide. On the other hand, there are even rumors that some of the listed employees to be fired could be involved one way or another. Nonetheless, the Dodge Line policy is more or less the cause of his death."

 japan.7.d:0 "Yesterday, on 15th July, at 09:23 local time, a runaway unmanned train travelling at the speed of about 60 kilometers per hour broke through a buffer stop and plunged into a nearby shopping street, killing six people and injuring twenty, at Mitaka Station, Chuo Main Line.\nInvestigation authorities have arrested ten Japanese Communist Party members, and a former train driver, Keisuke Takeuchi, who is a non-communist, over suspicions of a possible joint conspiracy aimed at the communist revolution. The final trial and the court ruling on the matter is yet to happen.\nThis incident occured not too long after the recent Shimoyama Incident, where the first Japan National Railways president, Sadanori Shimoyama, was found dead on the Joban line, and people have already begun to question the authenticity of finger-pointing at the Japan National Railway Union and the JCP over these two incidents."
 japan.7.a:0 "Questionable."
 japan.8.d:0 "Another railway incident happened, unsurprisingly. Today at 03:09, a Tohoku Main Line passenger train derailed and overturned by a curved track section, en route from Aomori Station to Ueno Station. The locomotive overturned, killing three crewmen; however, none of the 412 passengers were injured or killed. Investigators discovered that the bolts and nuts on the track joints had been loosened, and a large number of railroad spikes fixing the rails to the sleepers had been removed, along with a spanner and pry bar in a nearby rice paddy. As usual, suspicion immediately fell on the Japan National Railway Union, workers at the nearby Toshiba-Matsukawa factory and the Japanese Communist Party, due to recent protests over staff cuts. Ten workers from the Matsukawa plant and ten workers from the Japan National Railway were indicted and charged with sabotage.\nThe fact that this, along with the recent Shimoyama and Mitaka incidents happened within the span of two months, a conspiracy theory has sprouted that the GHQ with the help of the US intelligence perpetrated the incidents as a pretext to arrest the members of the Japan National Railway Union and the JCP to thwart any possible communist infuence. These incidents are referred to as the 'JNR's Three Major Mystery Incidents' among the Japanese."

 japan.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Purged Officials Released!"
 japan.9.d:0 "After Japan's defeat in the Second World War and the subsequent American occupation, the US Government proposed a policy of the expulsion of militaristic and nationalist officials from governmental and public offices; it was done for quickening the efforts of the 'democratisation' of Japan.\nHowever, in recent days, Prime Minister Yoshida negotiated with the GHQ and issued a statement calling for the release of the purged through the Second Appeals Office, and deemed it necessary for Japan's political and economic reconstruction. The appeals office has accepted a number of appeal applications, and plans to release the officials in the following months. Although, this does not necessarily mean that the left-wing radicals and communists will be spared, this act will return some kind of stability to Japanese politics and reduce political violence from the remaining right-wing activists."

 jap_jsp.1.d:0 "An intra-party dispute broke out over the draft of a campaign policy at the Fourth Congress of the Japan Socialist Party in 1949. Tatsuo Morito and Junzo Inamura, members of the right-wing and the left-wing of the JSP respectively, confronted each other with their respective proposals.\nWhile Morito's proposal characterized the party as a 'national party' and was anti-communist per the rules of parliamentarism, Inamura's proposal illustrated the party as a 'class party' that would reform the social system through revolution and possibly cooperating with the Japanese Communist Party.\nIn the end, through the mediation of Seiichi Katsumada, it was decided that the party's character should be described in the campaign policy as "a party that is a democratic organization of the broad working masses, including the working class at its core, peasants, small and medium-sized business people, and the intellectual class". The entire campaign policy also took on a strong leftist stance, and the left-wing Mosaburo Suzuki replaced the right-wing Inajiro Asanuma as secretary-general, which would only widen the cleavage between the left and the right. This comes to show that the controversy is but a prototype of future possible intra-party disputes."
 jap_jsp.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 jap_jsp.2.d:0 "As it inevitably happened, the Japan Socialist Party, known as the 'Nihon Shakaito' among the Japanese, split up after months of the tussle between the right-wing and the left-wing.\nThe divisions between the two wings can trace back to 1945 when the JSP was formed from multiple proletarian parties which had varying and often, conflicting interpretations of socialism. Cracks in the JSP began to emerge when six left-wing members were dimissed from the Ashida cabinet in 1948 to eliminate opposition against the budget plan. The Morito-Inamura controversy from two years ago also contributed immensely to the split where the campiagn policies of both wings contradicted with each other's ideals. And just today, dispute over supporting the Treaty of San Francisco dealt a final blow to the crippled unity between the two wings.\nThe JSP is now split in two, the Right Socialist Party led by Jotaro Kawakami, which follows the policy of centre-left social democracy, and the Left Socialist Party led by Mosaburo Suzki, which radically follows the policy of trotskyist-style revolutionary socialism. This incident might foreshadow the possible fall of socialism in Japan, for now."

 jap_police_law_of_1954.1.d:0 "Roughly three weeks ago, an ammendment bill to the Police Law was passed by the House of the Representatives and the session was scheduled to conclude on this date. However, due to unkown reasons, the Speaker of the House of the Representatives, Yasujiro Tsutsumi, proposed a two-day extension of the session.\nBelieving the extension to be invalid and unnecessary, the opposition members barred the Speaker from taking his seat in an attempt to overturn the proposed extension. Left with no other choice, the Speaker summoned the Diet police to maintain order and discipline; though, it only escalated the situation as the house members and the police engaged in a brutal brawl./nFortunately, the incident didn't result in severe injuries, although a handful had to be hospitalized. The session has been extended for two days as proposed, though this incident will certainly bring unpleasant consequences."

 jap_police_law_of_1954.2.d:0 "With the recent unexpected extension of the session and a subsequent brawl, many are questioning its validity. It is asserted that when extending the session of the Diet, the Speaker of the House of Representatives must consult with the President of the House of Councillors before the House of Representatives makes a resolution. Deciding to extend the session based solely on the will of the House of Representatives from the start is a prominent flaw; plus, the Speaker was not present on his seat when the extension was announced. However, a counter-argument from others is that the majority of the House of Representatives decided to extend the session, which was accepted by the House of Councillors. Moreover, the Speaker could not take his seat due to obstruction. It can also be interpreted that in case of emergency, the will of the House of Representatives alone is sufficient by the nature of the extension of the session. Either way, it is nearly impossible rule out whether the extension was valid or not."

 jap_police_law_of_1954.3.d:0 "Although, the 19th House of the Representatives session was originally extended till today, 5th June, the Speaker has proposed to further extend the session till 15th June. This is mostly due to the major parties being absent for the last two days, especially the both Right and Left Socialist Parties; presumably as a protest for the recent extension of the session and the subsequent brawl that unfolded between the house members and the summoned Diet police. Thus, under these circumstances, no unanimous decision could be made over the Police Law ammendment bill which impelled the Speaker to once again extend the session."

 jap_police_law_of_1954.5.d:0 "The Police Law of 1947 has been fully revised through an ammendment and enforced. The newly reworked law states that 'the police are based on a democratic philosophy in order to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals and maintain public safety and order'.\nThe main factors behind the revision is the democratisation of the police as well as centralising the management and structure. The decentralised police agencies have a heavy financial burden on local governments, and excessive fragmentation of police organizations has led to excessive territorial disputes and made wide-area investigation difficult. In addition, the national and local police and the local police were on an equal footing, and the responsibility for national security became unclear. Under the new law, the existing national and local police agencies were dissolved and replaced with the newly established 'National Police Agency' which would cooperate with the prefectural police agencies."
