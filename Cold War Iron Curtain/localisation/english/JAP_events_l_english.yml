 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "Today the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations between Japan and the Allied Powers. This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined. Moreover, Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts according to Article 11.\nThough, the signed treaty is yet to be enforced, this day means big for Japan and its people, for the nation will be finally free from the occupation."

 jap_startup.1.d:0 "As the sun sets on the remnants of a once-mighty empire, the Land of the Rising Sun finds itself shackled under the weight of defeat and foreign occupation. The echoes of the atomic bombings that marked the Empire of Japan's downfall in 1945 still resonate, casting a somber shadow over the nation.\n\nUnder the grasp of the American boot, we have undergone a radical transformation. The year 1947 saw the birth of a new era as the American-influenced constitution took root, birthing a fledgling democracy. Our sacred soil, once guarded by the samurai spirit, now bears the seeds of constitutional principles, most notably in the pacifist embrace of Article 9 that dismantled the once-mighty military machine.\n\nHowever, the winds of change bring not only renewal but also a tempest of challenges. Hyperinflation grips the economy, food shortages persist, and the industrial heartbeat of the nation struggles to recover. Political turbulence, fueled by far-left activists, threatens the fragile stability that remains. Our nation, though downcast, stand resilient.\n\nYet, within the heart of adversity lies our spirit of Yamato. We as a nation with the history of persevering through trials and tribulations, have an undying determination to transcend the hardships. In the hushed whispers beneath the cherry blossoms, there lies a promise that the Land of the Rising Sun will ascend once more. Hope flickers like a lantern in the night, guiding us through the tumultuous path to recovery. With unwavering loyalty to the Emperor and a profound sense of duty, the our nation looks toward the future. From the ashes of defeat, we pledge to rebuild an indomitable nation, for the glory of the Emperor and the enduring spirit of the nation!"
 jap_startup.1.a:0 "Japan will rise again..."
 
 japan.1.d:0 "In the wake of the post-occupation era, Japan's evolving stance on Article 9 of its Constitution paved the way for enhanced military capabilities. The Cold War climate further compelled Japan to recognise the imperative of self-defense capabilities in global affairs. Backed by U.S. support, this culminated in the establishment of a Defense Agency and the conversion of the National Security Force into the 'Japan Self-Defense Forces' – a military in all but nomenclature. However, its role is strictly limited to self-defense purposes while closely monitored by the US. The JSDF, comprising the JGSDF, JASDF, and JMSDF, emerges as a response to the geopolitical situation, ensuring Japan's preparedness for self-defense while navigating the delicate nuances of its constitutional framework. Despite the limitations, the JSDF's formation bolsters the Western bloc's delicate stance in Asia, underscoring Japan's freshly asserted national sovereignty."

The newly proposed 'Great Showa Consolidation' will help the nation’s efforts to cope with the changes brought about by the so-called post-war reforms, especially the government acting under the new Constitution of 1947 as well as the Local Autonomy Law of 1947.  Under this postwar local government system, the roles of municipalities were enhanced and they were charged with the responsibility of operating junior high schools, carrying out fire prevention activities, and dealing with social welfare matters. With the steadily growing population, and thus, growing number of junior highschoolers, as well as the junior high school system being newly-introduced, running them is bound to burden each individual municipality.\nFor this purpose, the Great Showa Consolidation will be underpinned by two municipal merger laws in order to make running the junior highschools effective as well as polish the municipal administration.

 japan.4.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the 'Truman Doctrine', the United States had announced its unyielding stance against communism, with Japan as a target to cleanse it from far-leftist radicals. Last year, with the US diplomat, George Kennan, pressuring MacArthur to change his moderate policy, unrest spilled out between spring and summer as a series of demonstrations by laborers, students and teachers, were held across the major cities of Japan. Unsurprisingly, after approval from Washington, the occupation authorities along with the Eighth Army aggressively suppressed these movements. The infamous "Hanshin Education Incident" occured in April when the Japanese authorities under the directions of the US government and the Japanese Ministry of Education closed down private Korean ethnic schools operating in Japan; it is said such actions were prompted by the fears of possible communist infiltration in the schools. Furthermore, later in September, then-Prime Minister of Japan and a left-leaning politician, Hitoshi Ashida, was arrested along with some of his cabinet officials over the infamous 'Showa Denko Scandal'.\nWith the fresh legacy of last year's events, economic uncertainity, Kyosan-to's political endeavors and the formation of the Zengakuren, far-leftism is only bound to spread across the nation if left unchecked; thus, the situation neccessitates the continuation of slamming the red menace."
 japan.4.a:0 "It was necessary..."
 japan.5.d:0 "As the part of the ongoing 'Red Purge' to curb the growing communist threat in Japan, the GHQ's Civil and Information and Education Section has made plans to ensure the education system stays pure from any far-left ideals. For this purpose, the authorities dispatched Dr. Walter C. Eells, who serves at the GHQ as an advisor on higher education, to thirty national universities to call for immediate dismissal of communist-sympathising professors and staff. Eells also visited Niigata University and labelled communism as "dangerous and destructive doctrine". Due to his ideals, anti-communism is slowly becoming a nationwide sentiment and openly shunned by the national newspapers. Plus, there have been noticeable dismissals of far-left sympathisers from educational institutes, mostly over irrelevant reasons. This endeavour is commonly known as the 'Eells Typhoon', or 'Izuru Senpu', as we call it.\n\nSome people argue that Eells's actions are a blatant suppression of academic freedom in Japan, while some would defend him, claiming that the CIE was never directly involved in the red purge. Either way one thing remains clear, that the 'Izuru Senpu' is a critical element in the ongoing red purge."

 japan.6.d:0 "The first president of Japanese National Railways, Sadanori Shimoyama, was recently found dead on the Joban Line, Adachi, after reported missing yesterday. Based on the official autopsy led by Professor Tanemoto Furuhata, it was determined that Shimoyama died prior to being hit by the train, with blood loss being possible due to the lack of blood on the body. Additionally, in some parts of the body, internal bleeding was found, which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking. On the other hand, it is also believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining.\n\nA few days prior to his death, Shimoyama was ordered for personnel cutbacks of JNR under the Dodge Line policy and released a list of 30,000 employees to be fired. It is rumoured that he recieved death threats from the high level US military officials to make sure he goes through with the order, which could have caused severe mental distress and hence, possible suicide. On the other hand, there are even rumours that some of the listed employees to be fired could be involved one way or another. Nonetheless, the incident remains a mystery."

Investigation authorities have arrested ten Kyosan-to workers, and a former train driver, Keisuke Takeuchi, over suspicions of a possible joint conspiracy as part of the far-left activism. However, the final trial and the court ruling on the matter is yet to happen.\n\nThis incident occured not too long after the recent Shimoyama Incident, where the first JNR president, Sadanori Shimoyama, was found dead on the Joban line, and people have already begun to question the authenticity of finger-pointing at the Japan National Railway Union (Kokuro) and the Kyosan-to over these two incidents."

Today, a Tohoku Main Line passenger train derailed and overturned by a curved track section, en route from Aomori Station to Ueno Station. The locomotive overturned, killing three crewmen; however, none of the 412 passengers were injured or killed. Investigators discovered that the bolts and nuts on the track joints had been loosened, and a large number of railroad spikes fixing the rails to the sleepers had been removed, along with a spanner and pry bar in a nearby rice paddy. As usual, suspicion immediately fell on the Kokuro, workers at the nearby Toshiba-Matsukawa factory and the Kyosan-to workers, due to recent protests over staff cuts. Ten workers from the Matsukawa plant and ten JNR employees were indicted and charged with sabotage.\n\nThe fact that this, along with the recent Shimoyama and Mitaka incidents happened within the span of two months, a conspiracy theory has sprouted that the GHQ with the help of the US intelligence perpetrated the incidents as a pretext to arrest the members of Kokuro and Kyosan-to to thwart any possible far-leftist activism."

The CVH Proposal, crafted after extensive deliberation by defense experts, seeks to bolster research and development efforts focused on carriers and helicopters for the JMSDF. The initiative presents a significant opportunity to strengthen Japan's maritime security, as it would provide the JMSDF with modern and versatile assets necessary for safeguarding the nation's territorial waters and contributing to international security efforts. Carriers and helicopters form the backbone of any effective naval force, enabling swift deployment of personnel, supplies, and equipment over vast maritime territories.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that implementing this proposal may attract mild political backlash as the opposition believes that doing so will violate the pacifist constitution and would contribute to an unnecessary arms race."

 jap_jsp.1.d:0 "An intra-party dispute broke out over the draft of a campaign policy at the Fourth Congress of the Japan Socialist Party in 1949. Tatsuo Morito and Junzo Inamura, members of the right-wing and the left-wing of the JSP respectively, confronted each other with their respective proposals.\nWhile Morito's proposal characterized the party as a 'national party' and was anti-communist per the rules of parliamentarism, Inamura's proposal illustrated the party as a 'class party' that would reform the social system through revolution and possibly cooperating with the Japanese Communist Party.\nIn the end, through the mediation of Seiichi Katsumada, it was decided that the party's character should be described in the campaign policy as "a party that is a democratic organization of the broad working masses, including the working class at its core, peasants, small and medium-sized business people, and the intellectual class". The entire campaign policy also took on a strong leftist stance, and the left-wing Mosaburo Suzuki replaced the right-wing Inajiro Asanuma as secretary-general, which would only widen the cleavage between the left and the right. This comes to show that the controversy is but a prototype of future possible intra-party disputes."

 jap_jsp.2.d:0 "As it inevitably happened, the Japan Socialist Party, known as the 'Nihon Shakaito' among the Japanese, split up after months of the tussle between the right-wing and the left-wing.\nThe divisions between the two wings can trace back to 1945 when the JSP was formed from multiple proletarian parties which had varying and often, conflicting interpretations of socialism. Cracks in the JSP began to emerge when six left-wing members were dimissed from the Ashida cabinet in 1948 to eliminate opposition against the budget plan. The Morito-Inamura controversy from two years ago also contributed immensely to the split where the campiagn policies of both wings contradicted with each other's ideals. And just today, dispute over supporting the Treaty of San Francisco dealt a final blow to the crippled unity between the two wings.\nThe JSP is now split in two, the Right Socialist Party led by Jotaro Kawakami, which follows the policy of centre-left social democracy, and the Left Socialist Party led by Mosaburo Suzki, which radically follows the policy of trotskyist-style revolutionary socialism. This incident might foreshadow the possible fall of socialism in Japan, for now."

Deciding to extend the session based solely on the will of the House of Representatives from the start is a prominent flaw; plus, the Speaker was not present on his seat when the extension was announced. However, a counter-argument from others is that the majority of the House of Representatives decided to extend the session, which was accepted by the House of Councillors. Moreover, the Speaker could not take his seat due to obstruction. It can also be interpreted that in case of emergency, the will of the House of Representatives alone is sufficient by the nature of the extension of the session. Either way, it is nearly impossible rule out whether the extension was valid or not."

The decentralised police agencies have a heavy financial burden on local governments, and excessive fragmentation of police organizations has led to excessive territorial disputes and made wide-area investigation difficult. In addition, the national and local police and the local police were on an equal footing, and the responsibility for national security became unclear. Under the new law, the existing national and local police agencies were dissolved and replaced with the newly established 'National Police Agency' which would cooperate with the prefectural police agencies."

Participation in the event extended beyond the confines of Sohyo-constituent councils, with the inclusion of other civil unions such as Sodomei, Nikkyoso, Kokuro, Tororen, Kaiin, and Shitetsuroren.\n\nThe establishment of Sohyo was significantly influenced by the Allied Occupation GHQ, playing a pivotal role in guiding the union's trajectory. During the founding congress, a declaration was adopted under GHQ guidance, explicitly excluding Kyosan-to ideals. Additionally, there was an emphasis on fostering warm relations with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Cleansing labour unions of political parties' influence and concentrating on labour economic struggles were also among the key elements of the agenda. Now, Sohyo emerges as a distinctive trade union entity, boasting anti-communist overtones. However, knowing the nature of labor unions, their current anti-communist stance may not last for an extended period. This is already evident in the active involvement of prominent left-socialist activists led by Takano Minoru. Takano, with strong connections to the Kyosan-to, is determined to persuade the Sohyo unions to move away from their anti-communist perspective, notwithstanding the recent initiative adopted during the convention."

The Principles of Peace include opposition to rearmament and expansion of Japan's defense forces, emphasising a total adherence to Article 9. Secondly, advocating for Japan to join the non-aligned movement and maintain neutrality in the brewing Cold War, steering away from a pro-West stance. Finally. opposing US military bases in Japan and supporting the organisation of anti-American military base protests. A pivotal moment in the convention was the rejection of the previous goal of joining the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, intensifying tensions between the opposing wings.\n\nThese principles marked a drastic shift from the agenda set in the first convention, indicating a significant move within the political spectrum in less than a year.

A notable point of contention arose regarding the newly-enforced Treaty of Francisco. The right-wing members advocated for a more conciliatory approach, emphasising cooperation with the government, while the left-wing faction insisted on an aggressive opposition strategy. The latter aligned closely with the policies of Shakai-to's left-wing splinter group, Shakai-to Uha. In a decision reflecting the dominance of the left within Sohyo, the higher-ups resolved to support the Shakai-to Uha, unequivocally affirming the leftist orientation of the organisation. Susumu Fujita emerged as the newly elected Committee Chairman of Densan, further solidifying the left-leaning leadership. Additionally, Minoru Takano retained his position as secretary general. Despite the contentious issues discussed during the convention, no concessions were made to appease the right-wing faction.

These principles, rooted in Marxism and Leninism, encompass various aspects, including opposition to capitalistic rationalisation, the unification of the labour front, the protection and maintenance of peace, and the stabilisation of peacetime economy. Remarkably, Sohyo underwent a substantial transformation within a brief span of three years. Originating as an anti-communist movement, the organisation has now embraced a stance entirely opposite to its earlier position.\n\nWithin the Sohyo framework, a faction known as Minroren has emerged, comprised of right-wing unions seeking to moderate the organization's policies from within. However, three right-wing unions, namely Kaiin, Zensen Domei, and Zeneien, have reached a breaking point with Sohyo's left-dominated direction.

Additionally, the right-wing members of Sohyo aligned with the Minroren faction, alongside the right-wingers of Sodomei, were present, collectively forming the right-leaning Zenro Kaigi as a formidable rival to Sohyo.\n\nZenro's primary objective is to counter Sohyo's leftist pursuits, aiming to eliminate all pro-Communist tendencies within affiliated labor unions and positioning itself on the side of the 'free world'. The organization also denounces politically motivated strike activities, particularly those orchestrated by Sohyo, and expresses the intent to seek affiliation with the ICFTU. In contrast to a hard-line socialist stance, Zenro leans towards a more moderate social democracy. Notably, the council opposes immediate rearmament for Japan, advocating instead for a guarantee of Japan's security through the United Nations.\n\nPresently boasting a membership of 700,000, Zenro Kaigi's future growth may serve as an indicator of the Japanese labour movement's evolving political trajectory. The polarisation suggests the initiation of a mini cold war within the labour politics."

Established a decade ago in 1948, Sanbetsu Kaigi was initially hailed as one of the prominent national industrial councils. However, fractures within the organisation were evident right from its inception. The inclusion of pro-democratic elements triggered disputes with leftist sympathisers, resulting in early-stage attrition of its membership. The presence of the Mindo faction, an anti-communist group, further exacerbated internal divisions as left-leaning members sought closer ties with the Kyosan-to. By 1949, during the peak of the 'Red Purge,' Sanbetsu Kaigi grappled to maintain its eminence. The expulsion of left-wing activists from workplaces nationwide shattered its legitimacy, leading to a cascade of splits in labor unions and withdrawals from the council. The year 1950 proved to be the worst one for the organisation, as the occupation authorities directly suppressed the Kyosan-to and affiliated groups, including Sanbetsu Kaigi. The loss of a majority of its civil servants from key positions ensued. The establishment of Sohyo later that summer dealt a final blow, prompting a significant exodus of major constituent unions to Sohyo.

 jap_parties.2.d:0 "Today, lawmakers from Kokukyo-to and the remnants of Minshu-to have reached an agreement to merge, forming a new political entity known as Kokumin Minshu-to, abbreviated as Kokumin-to.\n\nThis development follows the recent fracture of Minshu-to, where a faction split off and joined forces with Minji-to to create Jiyu-to, leaving Minshu-to in disarray and facing a manpower shortage. Prior to the merger, discussions took place between Kokukyo-to's Miki and Minshu-to's Ashida. They deliberated on the necessity of creating a broad-based party that could accommodate some socialist elements. However, due to practical considerations, merging with the right wing of Shakai-to was deemed unpleasible. While Ashida did not publicly oppose Miki's stance, he recognised the urgent issues of Minshu-to, including a shortage of human resources and political funds.\n\nIn light of these considerations, an agreement for the merger was reached, leading to the formation of Kokumin-to with the democrat Gizo Tomabechi as the chairman. This decision comes just ahead of the upcoming House of Councilors election in the summer."

 jap_parties.3.t:0 "Formation of Kaishin-to"
 jap_parties.3.d:0 "Today marks the establishment of a new political party, known as Kaishin-to. The party has come into existence through the amalgamation of Kokumin-to and Nokyo-to, with the former's lawmakers forming the core of this newly created entity. Kaishin-to positions itself as a predominantly centrist party.\n\nPrior to the merger, deliberations were held regarding the potential union with Nokyo-to. Notably, concerns were raised, particularly by members of the former Minshu-to, regarding the adoption of 'moderate socialistic policies.' Despite these reservations, an agreement was ultimately reached, culminating in the formation of Kaishin-to. The convention also witnessed the participation of members from the Shinsei Club, a splinter group of Minsei Kyuyukai (which is an association of pre-war ex-democrats).However, due to ongoing disagreements between pro-Ashida and pro-Miki lawmakers, the position of chairman within the newly formed party will remain vacant temporarily. Efforts are underway to resolve these differences and appoint a chairman in the near future.\n\nKaishin-to, as opposed to Jiyu-to, has declared the following agenda: advocating for Japan's independent self-defense, creating a national spirit without radicalism, and implementing progressive reforms."

 jap_parties.4.d:0 "After the infamous "Bakayaro Dissolution" months ago, dissident anti-Yoshida lawmakers splintered from Jiyu-to, uniting under the leadership of Hatoyama. Following their defeat in the recent general elections, most rejoined Yoshida's party, including Hatoyama himself. Yet, eight steadfast dissenters, hailed as the Eight Samurai, defied the trend. Together, they boldly declared the establishment of Nippon Jiyu-to (Niji-to for short). Under the leadership of Ichiro Kono as Chief Secretary and Bukichi Miki as Supreme Consultant, Niji-to emerges with a singular goal: to dismantle Yoshida's entrenched 'one-man dominance.'"

 jap_parties.5.d:0 "Since the Shipbuilding Scandal surfaced, and public prosecutors launched an investigation into a top officials of the ruling Jiyu-to on suspicion of bribery, Yoshida's cabinet approval rate has been plummeting. Jiyu-to released a proposal to form a new party by merging with the Kaishin-to. But the proposal, put forward by the Jiyu-to Deputy, Taketora Ogata, met with opposition and the idea was not materialised. Instead, the Kaishin-to tried to create a new party aimed at countering Yoshida.\n\nMeanwhile, Nobusuke Kishi and Tanzan Ishibashi, both anti-Yoshida lawmakers within Jiyu-to, and Hitoshi Ashida of Kaishin-to moved to form a new party aimed at countering Yoshida by setting up a preparatory committee for creating such a party. In reponse, Yoshida expelled Kishi and Ishibashi from the party while anti-Yoshida factions within Jiyu-to departed the ruling party. Today, these forces join hands with the Kaishin-to and Niji-to, leading to the creation of Nihon Minshu-to (Nimin-to for short). Ichiro Hatoyama was elected as the president of the new party and Mamoru Shigemitsu was named the deputy president."

 jap_parties.6.t:0 "A Conservative Merger?"
 jap_parties.6.d:0 "In this decade, conservatives have consistently dominated elections, preventing any socialist ascent to the prime minister's office. The division within the Shakai-to has played a pivotal role in fracturing socialist political endeavors. However, the ongoing Yoshida-Hatoyama rivalry has left the conservative camp in disarray, which can jeopardies their winning streak. Sensing the vulnerability, discussions have emerged between the right and left wings of Shakai-to regarding a unified front against the conservatives. The prospect of a united Shakai-to poses a significant threat, capable of overpowering the divided conservative parties.\n\nSimultaneously, the Jiyu-to and Nimin-to leaders find themselves under pressure from the business community (Keidanren). The Keidanren asserts the necessity of a stable conservative coalition to counterbalance the rising influence of the Shakai-to. This urgency stems from the Keidanren's commitment to technological innovation and production rationalisation. They argue that a stable conservative government is vital for maintaining a positive relationship with the United States; on the other hand, the socialists openly advocate an anti-US agenda.\n\nAmidst these considerations, there is a growing sentiment that a merger between Jiyu-to and Nimin-to should be seriously entertained, especially considering the imperative nature of the situation. The Keidanren's insistence on prompt action underscores the belief that a consolidated conservative front is essential for averting the potential rise of the Shakai-to and securing a stable political environment conducive to their economic interests. Perhaps, it's better if we consider it done as soon as possible."

 jap_parties.7.t:0 "Discussions for the Conservative Merger"
 jap_parties.7.d:0 "With the concept of the conservative merger in light, conservative politicians from both Hatoyama's party and Yoshida's party have considered its prospects. The prime movers are Nihon-to's executive committee chairman, Bukichi Miki, and Jiyu-to's secretary-general, Banboku Ono. Nobusuke Kishi, Taketora Ogata, and Mitsujiro Ishii are also among the proponents of the conservative merger.\n\nHowever, opposition from both Hatoyama and Yoshida, as well as the long-time rivalry between the Honryu Conservatives and Boryu Conservatives due to the complex relationship between the pre-war bureaucrats and political elites, prove to be the main hindrances to the progress of the merger. Moreover, there has been a rift between Hatoyama and Ono over the sausage-making deals being made to facilitate the merger, especially with Hatoyama favouring Miki's views over Ono's."

 jap_parties.8.t:0 "The Ogata Report"
 jap_parties.8.d:0 "In a report presented by a CIA officer by interviewing Taketora Ogata, the current president of Jiyu-to, a comprehensive evaluation of the political landscape unveils insights leading up to upcoming general elections as well as the prospect of a 'conservative merger'. According to Ogata, Jiyu-to is anticipated to experience a maximum loss of ten seats, while the Nimin-to could potentially gain up to 20 seats. This could leave Jiyu-to with a 30-seat plurality, indicating a shift in the conservative camp.\n\nOgata has voiced his desire for a merger with Nimin-to, albeit recognising the need for approximately three months of groundwork. He views key figures within Nimin-to, including Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi, Finance Minister Hisato Ichimada, and Nimin-to Advisor Hitoshi Ashida, as an excellent group with whom discussions about the potential merger could be fruitful. Expressing determination to lay the foundation for a conservative absolute majority within a year, Ogata has not ruled out the possibility of revising election laws if deemed necessary for achieving this ambitious goal.\n\nOgata also highlights the decision by Kyosan-to to employ regular election methods, foreseeing both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, Ogata believes that the communist candidates may split the leftist vote, potentially costing the Shakai-to seats and thereby aiding the conservatives. However, he notes the potential downside where the Kyosan-to could be perceived by the Japanese people as an ordinary parliamentary party rather than as a tool influenced by the USSR. Ogata even speculates that the socialist camp may be receiving substantial financial assistance from abroad, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim."

 jap_parties.9.d:0 "A visit was made to Mr. Matsutaro Shoriki (owner of Yomiuri Shimbun, president of Nitteru., and a Lower House member) at his home in Zushi on the Sunday afternoon. The conversation mostly consisted of his political activities during the past 2 years.\n\nHe stated that he spent his best effort in trying to bring Yoshida and Hatoyama together to reconciliate about 2 years ago. Shoriki visited Hatoyama at Nirayama. No sooner than he broached the subject to Hatoyama, who was so angered that he left the room and refused to talk to him any further. Shoriki, therefore, merely had lunch with Mrs. Hatoyama and Tomejiro Okubo, the current state minister and director general of the Hokkaido Development Board, without accomplishing his mission.\n\nShoriki stated that Yoshida persistently told him that he would like to turn over the government to Hatoyama when the time comes, and Shorika firmly believed this assurance to be bona fide until Yoshida stated in the press interview given at Paris during his last trip abroad, that the rein of government cannot be turned over to an 'invalid' like Hatoyama. From that day, he says that he realised that he had been betrayed, and he completely changed his attitude towards Yoshida and from the very next day he ordered Yomiuri to change its editorial policy to oppose Yoshida's party.\n\nAt the time of the political crisis of last November, he said that he maintained intimate liaison with Banboku Ono, Chairman of the Executive Board of Jiyu-to and worked toward resignation of Yoshida cabinet instead of Diet dissolution. Concerning the current movement for conservative merger, he even stated that it was he who brought Bukichi Miki and Bamboku Ono, who were traditional enemies, to meet secretly to lay the ground for the merger."

 jap_parties.10.d:0 "In today's special convention held at the Kyoritsu Auditorium, the right and left wings of Shakai-to have set aside their differences and reunified. Spearheaded by Mosaburo Suzuki from the left-wing and Jotaro Kawakami from the right-wing, the merger faced internal resistance, notably from Sueshiro Nishio of the right-wing, critical of the left's stance on constitutional revision and its alignment with the radical Sohyo.\n\nDespite the opposition, a unified Shakai-to poses a formidable challenge to the conservative forces, currently grappling with internal divisions between the Yoshida and Hatoyama factions. The urgency to counteract the socialist threat has accelerated the conservative merger, as both camps navigate negotiations to present a united front against the Shakai-to."

Achieve economic independence through stabilisation of currency value and long-term economic planning.\n4. Establish a welfare system.\n5.

 jap_parties.12.d:0 "Today marks a historical moment in Japanese politics as the conservative factions of Jiyu-to and Nimin-to set aside their differences and opposition, uniting to form a powerful conservative front. This united party emerges as a counterforce to the recently united socialist camp, presenting a significant shift in the political landscape. The crucial matter of the party's presidency remains under deliberation, prompting the establishment of a four-member presidential committee. This committee, comprising Ichiro Hatoyama, Bukichi Miki, Taketora Ogata, and Banboku Ono, will play a decisive role in determining the future leadership of the newly-formed party.\n\nWith this unity, it appears that the conservative forces have effectively neutralised the perceived threat posed by the socialist faction, marking a turning point in the political dynamics of Japan."
