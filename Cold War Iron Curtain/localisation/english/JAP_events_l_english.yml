 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "Today the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations between Japan and the Allied Powers. This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined. Moreover, Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts according to Article 11.\nThough, the signed treaty is yet to be enforced, this day means big for Japan and its people, for the nation will be finally free from the occupation."

 jap_startup.1.d:0 "In August of 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing the war to a swift and brutal end. The devastation wrought by these weapons was staggering, with tens of thousands of people killed or injured in an instant. Japan's leadership was forced to confront the reality of their defeat, and to negotiate the terms of their surrender with the Allied powers. In the aftermath of the war, Japan was faced with a host of challenges. Its economy was in shambles, its infrastructure destroyed, and its people traumatized by the horrors of the conflict. The nation's leadership was forced to make difficult decisions about how to rebuild, while also grappling with the guilt and shame of their defeat. One of the most pressing issues facing Japan was the question of how to deal with war crimes committed during the conflict. Many Japanese officials and military leaders were responsible for atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war, and there was widespread anger and resentment towards these individuals. The nation's leadership was forced to navigate a delicate balancing act, seeking to hold those responsible accountable while also avoiding further humiliation on the world stage."

 japan.1.d:0 "Ever since the Japanese defeat at the end of the Second World War, the country has been under American military occupation and allowed no armed forces. However, with the rising tensions of the Cold War the American government has taken increasing steps towards developing Japan as a Capitalist ally in the East. With American forces facing engagements in the Korean War, Japan's incredibly exposed and vulnerable position has not gone unnoticed. Leftist and Communist-aligned strikes and demonstrations have also inflamed the situation and the United States clearly now sees it prudent to allow Japan to form its own military again. The Japanese government has now officially authorized the creation of a national military, however its role is to be limited specifically to self defense and will be tightly monitored by the US, still wary from the World War merely a decade prior. No matter the restrictions, the creation of the Japanese military helps reinforce the precarious Allied position in Asia, whilst highlighting Japan's new found national sovereignty."

Under this postwar local government system, the roles of municipalities were enhanced and they were charged with the responsibility of operating junior high schools, carrying out fire prevention activities, and dealing with social welfare matters. With the steadily growing population, and thus, growing number of junior highschoolers, as well as the junior high school system being newly-introduced, running them is bound to burden each individual municipality.\nFor this purpose, the Great Showa Consolidation will be underpinned by two municipal merger laws in order to make running the junior highschools effective as well as polish the municipal administration.

 japan.4.t:0 "The Red Purge"
 japan.4.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the 'Truman Doctrine', the United States had announced its unyielding stance against communism, with Japan as a target to cleanse it from far-leftist radicals. Last year, with the US diplomat, George Kennan, pressuring MacArthur to change his moderate policy, unrest spilled out between spring and summer as a series of demonstrations and protests by laborers, students and teachers, were held across the major cities of Japan. Unsurprisingly, after approval from Washington, the occupation authorities along with the Eighth Army aggressively suppressed these movements. The infamous "Hanshin Education Incident" occured in April when the Japanese authorities under the directions of the US government and the Japanese Ministry of Education closed down private Korean ethnic schools operating in Japan; it is said such actions were prompted by the fears of possible communist infiltration in the schools. Furthermore, later in September, then-Prime Minister of Japan and a left-leaning politician, Hitoshi Ashida, was arrested along with some of his cabinet officials over the infamous 'Showa Denko Scandal'.\nWith the fresh legacy of last year's events, economic uncertainity, the Japanese Communist Party's political endeavors and the formation of the student associations, the Zengakuren, communism is only bound to spread across the nation if left unchecked; thus, the situation neccessitates the continuation of slamming the red menace."
 japan.4.a:0 "It was necessary..."
 japan.5.d:0 "As the part of the ongoing 'Red Purge' to curb the growing communist threat in Japan, the GHQ's Civil and Information and Education Section (CIE) has made plans to ensure the education system stays pure from any far-leftist ideals. For this purpose, the authorities dispatched Dr. Walter C. Eells, who serves at the GHQ as an advisor on higher education, to thirty national universities to call for immediate dismissal of communist professors and staff. On 16th July, Eells visited Niigata University and labelled communism as "dangerous and destructive doctrine". Due to his ideals, anti-communism is slowly becoming a nationwide sentiment and openly shunned by the newspapers. Plus, there have been noticeable dismissals of communist sympathizers from educational institutes, mostly over irrelevant reasons. This endeavor is commonly known as the 'Eells Typhoon', or 'Izuru Senpu', as the Japanese call it.\nSome people argue that Eells's actions are a blatant suppression of academic freedom in Japan, while some would defend him, claiming that the CIE was never directly involved in the red purge. Either way one thing remains clear, that the 'Izuru Senpu' is a critical element in the ongoing red purge."

 japan.6.d:0 "The first president of Japanese National Railways, Sadanori Shimoyama, was recently found dead on the Joban Line, Adachi after reported missing yesterday.\nBased on the official autopsy led by Professor Tanemoto Furuhata, it was determined that Shimoyama died prior to being hit by the train, with blood loss being possible due to the lack of blood on the body. Additionally, in some parts of the body, internal bleeding was found, which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking. On the other hand, it is also believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining.\nA few days prior to his death, Shimoyama was ordered for personnel cutbacks of JNR under the Dodge Line policy and released a list of 30,000 employees to be fired. It is rumored that he recieved death threats from the high level US military officials to make sure he goes through with the order, which could have caused severe depression and hence, possible suicide. On the other hand, there are even rumors that some of the listed employees to be fired could be involved one way or another. Nonetheless, the Dodge Line policy is more or less the cause of his death."

The final trial and the court ruling on the matter is yet to happen.\nThis incident occured not too long after the recent Shimoyama Incident, where the first Japan National Railways president, Sadanori Shimoyama, was found dead on the Joban line, and people have already begun to question the authenticity of finger-pointing at the Japan National Railway Union and the JCP over these two incidents."

The locomotive overturned, killing three crewmen; however, none of the 412 passengers were injured or killed. Investigators discovered that the bolts and nuts on the track joints had been loosened, and a large number of railroad spikes fixing the rails to the sleepers had been removed, along with a spanner and pry bar in a nearby rice paddy. As usual, suspicion immediately fell on the Japan National Railway Union, workers at the nearby Toshiba-Matsukawa factory and the Japanese Communist Party, due to recent protests over staff cuts. Ten workers from the Matsukawa plant and ten workers from the Japan National Railway were indicted and charged with sabotage.\nThe fact that this, along with the recent Shimoyama and Mitaka incidents happened within the span of two months, a conspiracy theory has sprouted that the GHQ with the help of the US intelligence perpetrated the incidents as a pretext to arrest the members of the Japan National Railway Union and the JCP to thwart any possible communist infuence. These incidents are referred to as the 'JNR's Three Major Mystery Incidents' among the Japanese."

Today, we have made a crucial decision that will determine the course of our nation's economy.

However, the proposal's potential for mild political backlash raises questions about its immediate approval.\nThe CVH Proposal, crafted after extensive deliberation by defense experts, seeks to bolster research and development efforts focused on carriers and helicopters for the JMSDF. The initiative presents a significant opportunity to strengthen Japan's maritime security, as it would provide the JMSDF with modern and versatile assets necessary for safeguarding the nation's territorial waters and contributing to international security efforts. Carriers and helicopters form the backbone of any effective naval force, enabling swift deployment of personnel, supplies, and equipment over vast maritime territories.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that implementing the CVH Proposal may attract mild political backlash as the opposition believes that doing so will violate the pacifist constitution and would contribute to an unnecessary arms race."

 jap_jsp.1.d:0 "An intra-party dispute broke out over the draft of a campaign policy at the Fourth Congress of the Japan Socialist Party in 1949. Tatsuo Morito and Junzo Inamura, members of the right-wing and the left-wing of the JSP respectively, confronted each other with their respective proposals.\nWhile Morito's proposal characterized the party as a 'national party' and was anti-communist per the rules of parliamentarism, Inamura's proposal illustrated the party as a 'class party' that would reform the social system through revolution and possibly cooperating with the Japanese Communist Party.\nIn the end, through the mediation of Seiichi Katsumada, it was decided that the party's character should be described in the campaign policy as "a party that is a democratic organization of the broad working masses, including the working class at its core, peasants, small and medium-sized business people, and the intellectual class". The entire campaign policy also took on a strong leftist stance, and the left-wing Mosaburo Suzuki replaced the right-wing Inajiro Asanuma as secretary-general, which would only widen the cleavage between the left and the right. This comes to show that the controversy is but a prototype of future possible intra-party disputes."

 jap_jsp.2.d:0 "As it inevitably happened, the Japan Socialist Party, known as the 'Nihon Shakaito' among the Japanese, split up after months of the tussle between the right-wing and the left-wing.\nThe divisions between the two wings can trace back to 1945 when the JSP was formed from multiple proletarian parties which had varying and often, conflicting interpretations of socialism. Cracks in the JSP began to emerge when six left-wing members were dimissed from the Ashida cabinet in 1948 to eliminate opposition against the budget plan. The Morito-Inamura controversy from two years ago also contributed immensely to the split where the campiagn policies of both wings contradicted with each other's ideals. And just today, dispute over supporting the Treaty of San Francisco dealt a final blow to the crippled unity between the two wings.\nThe JSP is now split in two, the Right Socialist Party led by Jotaro Kawakami, which follows the policy of centre-left social democracy, and the Left Socialist Party led by Mosaburo Suzki, which radically follows the policy of trotskyist-style revolutionary socialism. This incident might foreshadow the possible fall of socialism in Japan, for now."

Left with no other choice, the Speaker summoned the Diet police to maintain order and discipline; though, it only escalated the situation as the house members and the police engaged in a brutal brawl./nFortunately, the incident didn't result in severe injuries, although a handful had to be hospitalized.

It is asserted that when extending the session of the Diet, the Speaker of the House of Representatives must consult with the President of the House of Councillors before the House of Representatives makes a resolution. Deciding to extend the session based solely on the will of the House of Representatives from the start is a prominent flaw; plus, the Speaker was not present on his seat when the extension was announced. However, a counter-argument from others is that the majority of the House of Representatives decided to extend the session, which was accepted by the House of Councillors. Moreover, the Speaker could not take his seat due to obstruction. It can also be interpreted that in case of emergency, the will of the House of Representatives alone is sufficient by the nature of the extension of the session. Either way, it is nearly impossible rule out whether the extension was valid or not."

This is mostly due to the major parties being absent for the last two days, especially the both Right and Left Socialist Parties; presumably as a protest for the recent extension of the session and the subsequent brawl that unfolded between the house members and the summoned Diet police.

The decentralised police agencies have a heavy financial burden on local governments, and excessive fragmentation of police organizations has led to excessive territorial disputes and made wide-area investigation difficult. In addition, the national and local police and the local police were on an equal footing, and the responsibility for national security became unclear. Under the new law, the existing national and local police agencies were dissolved and replaced with the newly established 'National Police Agency' which would cooperate with the prefectural police agencies."

Next, Nishimura reacted by saying how Yoshida and his cabinet were as worse as Tojo Hideki, the infamous prime minister from the war. This all resulted in a brief argument between the two, but Yoshida decided to quickly withdraw his remarks.

Takeo Muto, a former coal worker, emerged as the first chairman, while Zengoro Shimagami, a former Sodomei trader, secured the position of secretary-general. Participation in the event extended beyond the confines of Sohyo-constituent councils, with the inclusion of other civil unions such as Sodomei, Nikkyoso, Kokuro, Tororen, Kaiin, and Shitetsuroren.\n\nThe establishment of Sohyo was significantly influenced by the Allied Occupation GHQ, playing a pivotal role in guiding the union's trajectory. During the founding congress, a declaration was adopted under GHQ guidance, explicitly excluding Kyosan-to ideals. Additionally, there was an emphasis on fostering warm relations with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Cleansing labour unions of political parties' influence and concentrating on labour economic struggles were also among the key elements of the agenda. Now, Sohyo emerges as a distinctive trade union entity, boasting its anti-communist overtones. However, knowing the nature of labor unions, its current anti-left stance may not last for an extended period. This is already evident in the active involvement of prominent left-socialist activists led by Takano Minoru. Takano, with strong connections to the Kyosan-to, is determined to persuade the Sohyo unions to move away from their anti-communist perspective, notwithstanding the recent initiative adopted during the convention."

The leftists, mostly led by Minoru Takano, advocated for adopting the Shakai-to's "Principles of Peace" as the new agenda, which striggered staunch opposition from the right-wing faction within Sohyo. The Principles of Peace include opposition to rearmament and expansion of Japan's defense forces, emphasising a total adherence to Article 9. Second, advocating for Japan to join the non-aligned movement and maintain neutrality in the brewing Cold War, steering away from a pro-West stance. Lastly, opposing US military bases in Japan and supporting the organisation of anti-US military base protests. A pivotal moment in the convention was the rejection of the previous goal of joining the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, intensifying tensions between the opposing wings.\n\nThese principles marked a drastic shift from the agenda set in the first convention, indicating a significant move within the political spectrum in less than a year. Now under the new leadership of the left-socialist Minoru Takano, Sohyo has unsurprisingly adapted a leftist stance, openly rejecting the pro-US policies of Japan."

A notable point of contention arose regarding the newly-enforced Treaty of Francisco. The right-wing members advocated for a more conciliatory approach, emphasising cooperation with the government, while the left-wing faction insisted on an aggressive opposition strategy. The latter aligned closely with the policies of Shakai-to's left-wing splinter group, Shakai-to Uha. In a decision reflecting the dominance of the left within Sohyo, the higher-ups resolved to support the Shakai-to Uha, unequivocally affirming the leftist orientation of the organisation. Susumu Fujita emerged as the newly elected Committee Chairman of Densan, further solidifying the left-leaning leadership. Additionally, Minoru Takano retained his position as secretary general. Despite the contentious issues discussed during the convention, no concessions were made to appease the right-wing faction. Consequently, the internal conflict between the left and right within Sohyo has intensified, signaling a deepening ideological schism within Sohyo."

These principles, rooted in Marxism and Leninism, encompass various aspects, including opposition to capitalistic rationalisation, the unification of the labour front, the protection and maintenance of peace, and the stabilisation of peacetime economy. Remarkably, Sohyo underwent a substantial transformation within a brief span of three years. Originating as an anti-communist movement, the organisation has now embraced a stance entirely opposite to its earlier position.\n\nWithin the Sohyo framework, a faction known as Minroren has emerged, comprised of right-wing unions seeking to moderate the organization's policies from within. However, three right-wing unions, namely Kaiin, Zensen Domei, and Zeneien, have reached a breaking point with Sohyo's left-dominated direction.

Additionally, the right-wing members of Sohyo aligned with the Minroren faction, alongside the right-wingers of Sodomei, were present, collectively forming the right-leaning Zenro Kaigi as a formidable rival to Sohyo.\n\nZenro's primary objective is to counter Sohyo's leftist pursuits, aiming to eliminate all pro-Communist tendencies within affiliated labor unions and positioning itself on the side of the 'free world'. The organization also denounces politically motivated strike activities, particularly those orchestrated by Sohyo, and expresses the intent to seek affiliation with the ICFTU. In contrast to a hard-line socialist stance, Zenro leans towards a more moderate social democracy. Notably, the council opposes immediate rearmament for Japan, advocating instead for a guarantee of Japan's security through the United Nations.\n\nPresently boasting a membership of 700,000, Zenro Kaigi's future growth may serve as an indicator of the Japanese labour movement's evolving political trajectory. The polarisation suggests the initiation of a mini cold war within the labour politics."

Established a decade ago in 1948, Sanbetsu Kaigi was initially hailed as one of the prominent national industrial councils. However, fractures within the organisation were evident right from its inception. The inclusion of pro-democratic elements triggered disputes with leftist sympathisers, resulting in early-stage attrition of its membership. The presence of the Mindo faction, an anti-communist group, further exacerbated internal divisions as left-leaning members sought closer ties with the Kyosan-to. By 1949, during the peak of the 'Red Purge,' Sanbetsu Kaigi grappled to maintain its eminence. The expulsion of left-wing activists from workplaces nationwide shattered its legitimacy, leading to a cascade of splits in labor unions and withdrawals from the council. The year 1950 proved to be the worst one for the organisation, as the occupation authorities directly suppressed the Kyosan-to and affiliated groups, including Sanbetsu Kaigi. The loss of a majority of its civil servants from key positions ensued. The establishment of Sohyo later that summer dealt a final blow, prompting a significant exodus of major constituent unions to Sohyo. Despite nearly eight years of stumbling and futile attempts to regain prominence, the members have now opted to dissolve the organisation for good."
