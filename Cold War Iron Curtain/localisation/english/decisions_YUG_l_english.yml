YUG_ethnicity_opinion: "The multicultural experiment 'Jugoslavija'"
YUG_ethnicity_opinion_desc: "Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of Yugoslavia is its distinct lack of a nation state. The people inhabiting this land may be classified as Southern Slavs but still are closer bound to their nationality than anything else. On top of that, the National Liberation War left scars, especially between the Serbs and Croats.  \n Should a too influental nationality become dissatisfied with the government, the consequences could lead to a national catastrophe.\n\n"
