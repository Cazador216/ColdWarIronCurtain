 macau.4.d:0 "Residents of Macau feel a wave of uncertainty today, as the Portuguese government and the Chinese communists have concluded a series of negotiations that puts the city under quasi-control of Beijing. Starting in early December, anti-colonial protestors demonstrated in the streets of the Portuguese-controlled city. These led to the Portuguese colonial authorities to crack down on the demonstrators, causing outrage within the Chinese government. After a tense month of negotiations and a statement of apology, Portugal has all but handed control of the city over to the People’s Republic.Though the city technically remains under the colonial authority of Portugal, most analysts agree that it is only a matter of time before Macau comes fully under the control of the Chinese government."
